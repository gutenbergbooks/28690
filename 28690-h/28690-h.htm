<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N my return from another visit to Japan a few months
ago I found those persons in this country with whom
I was brought into close association extremely curious and
strangely ignorant regarding that ancient Empire. Despite
the multitude of books which have of late years been published
about Japan and things Japanese a correct knowledge
of the country and the people is, so far as I can judge,
altogether lacking in England. Indeed the multiplicity of
books may have something to do with that fact, as many
of them have been written by persons whose knowledge,
acquired in the course of a flying visit, was, to say the least,
perfunctory, and who had no opportunities for viewing the
life of the people from within and forming a sound judgment
on many matters upon which the writers have
dogmatically pronounced. I, accordingly, came to the
conclusion not only that there was room for one more book
on Japan, but that another book was greatly needed&mdash;a book
not technical, historical, abstruse or recondite, but a book
describing in simple language Japan as it was, is, and will
be. This is the task I set before myself when I commenced
to write this volume, and the reader must be the judge to
what extent I have been successful in the accomplishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
thereof. I have touched but lightly on the material
development of the country of recent years. I know from
experience that though statistics are the fad of a few they
are caviare to the great mass of the public. Nor have I
dealt at all with politics or political parties in new Japan.
It is, I think, unfortunate that the Japanese people, in
adopting or adapting English institutions, should have
introduced the political party system so much in evidence
in Great Britain and other European countries. Whether
that system works well in the West, where it has been in
existence for centuries and is not always taken over-seriously
by party politicians themselves, is a question
upon which I shall express no opinion. But I think it is
problematical whether such a system is well adapted for
an Oriental people, possessed of and permeated by an
ancient civilisation&mdash;a people whose feelings, sentiments,
modes of thought, prejudices and passions are so essentially
different from those of Western nations. Be that
as it may, Japanese politics find no place in this work.</p>

<p>The morality or otherwise of the Japanese is a matter
which has been much discussed and written about. The
views of speakers and writers in regard thereto, so far as I
have been able to ascertain them, have been largely affected
by their prejudices or the particular standpoint from which
they have regarded the matter. The result, in my opinion,
has been that an entirely erroneous conception of the
whole subject of Japanese morality has not only been
formed but has been set forth in speech or writing, and a
grave injustice has been done to the Japanese in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
matter, to say nothing of the entirely false view of the whole
question which has been promulgated. In this book I have
endeavoured to deal with this thorny subject, so far as it
can be dealt with in a book, free from prejudice or preconceived
ideas of any kind. I have simply confined
myself to facts, and have endeavoured to represent the
whole matter as it appears to the Japanese and to morality
according to the Japanese standard.</p>

<p>I have deemed it necessary to deal at some length
with the various phases of Japanese art, which it is no
exaggeration to say has permeated the whole nation so
that the Japanese may truthfully be termed the most
artistic people in the world. Of course it is impossible to
deal exhaustively in a work of this kind with Japanese art.
I have, however, endeavoured to describe the principal art
industries of the country and to set forth what I may term
the catholicity of art in Japan. I have also dealt with the
question how far art has been affected by the Europeanising
of the nation which has taken place of recent years, and
the effect thereof.</p>

<p>The religion of the Japanese, the Constitution, the
home life of the people, the Army and Navy, the financial
position of the country are all subjects treated as fully
as possible, inasmuch as they are matters essential to be
understood in order to realise the Japan of to-day. The
Japan of the future I have attempted to forecast in two
final chapters.</p>

<p>But the Japan of to-day and the Japan of the future can
neither be understood nor realised unless the reader have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
in his mind some idea as to the Japan of the past&mdash;not the
barbaric or uncivilised Japan brought into contact with
civilisation and suddenly discarding its barbarism, which is,
I fear, the conception many persons still have, but, as I
have sought to show, a highly civilised country holding itself
aloof from European influences and excluding, so long as
possible, the European invasion of its shores just because
it had convinced itself by painful experience that European
ideas and manners and methods were undesirable
and unsuitable for a great island nation which possessed
and cherished a civilisation of its own, had high artistic
ideas and ideals, had its own code of morals, its own
conception of chivalry, and was, on the whole, undoubtedly
happy, contented, and prosperous. I trust the chapter I
have written on this subject will tend to dispel many
erroneous ideas.</p>

<p>The book is the result of my own investigations, and
the opinions expressed therein are entirely my own. I
have, however, read nearly every work on Japan that has
appeared in recent years, and when the views put forward
in any of these have not coincided with my own I have
endeavoured, by impartial investigation and inquiry, to
arrive at a correct conclusion in the matter. No doubt
some of my views and opinions will be questioned and
criticised, but I claim to have written this book with a
mind free from prejudices of any kind. I have sought
to depict Japan as it really is, not the Japan seen through
glasses of various colours, of which, I think, the public
has had enough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A GLIMPSE AT THE PAST</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> HAVE seen it stated in a popular handbook that
Japan possesses a written history extending over
two thousand five hundred years, while its sovereigns
have formed an unbroken dynasty since 660 <small>B.C.</small>, but
that the &ldquo;authentic history begins about 400 <small>A.D.</small>&rdquo;
&ldquo;Authentic history&rdquo; is, I consider, not a very apt
phrase in this connection. Most Japanese history is
legendary, and authenticity in history, Japanese or
European, even much later than 400 <small>A.D.</small>, is hopeless
to look for. I have no intention of leading my readers
into, as I should find a difficulty in extricating them
from, the mazes of Japanese history at any date. I
simply propose to give them a glimpse of Japan as it
has appeared to Europeans since it was first &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;
by three storm-tossed Portuguese sailors about the year
1542. I say &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; with full knowledge of the
fact that Marco Paolo, as early as 1275, dictated to a
friend when imprisoned at Genoa that stirring narrative,
&ldquo;Maravigliose Cose,&rdquo; which, by the way, was not printed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for nearly two centuries later. That narrative was read
by and, it is stated, so fired the imagination of Christopher
Columbus as to lead him to set out on that voyage of
exploration which ended in the discovery of America.
Marco Paolo&rsquo;s narrative must, however, be received with
caution. I regard it as largely legendary. He never
himself visited Japan, and his glowing description of the
&ldquo;Isles washed by stormy seas and abounding in gold and
pearls&rdquo; was founded on what he had been told by the
Chinese he had met during his Eastern travels.</p>

<p>The commencement of European intercourse with
Japan may, as I have said, be taken to be 1542, when
three Portuguese adventurers in a Chinese junk were
driven by stress of weather on a part of the Japanese
coast under the authority of the Prince of Bungo. The
Portuguese were kindly received by the natives, and a
treaty or arrangement seems to have been entered into
whereby a Portuguese vessel was to be annually despatched
to Japan laden with &ldquo;woollen cloths, furs, silks, taffetas,&rdquo;
and other articles. Some years later a Japanese noble,
Hansiro by name, murdered another Japanese and fled
the country. He found his way to Goa, where he came
under the influence of some Portuguese priests, and was
eventually converted to Christianity and baptized. He
was, if the records of his career are correct, desirous to
bring to his fellow-countrymen not only the knowledge
of the Christian religion but many articles of European
commerce. The great Apostle of the East and disciple
of Ignatius Loyola, St. Francis Xavier, had then recently
arrived in Goa, where he appears to have taken up with
ardour the project of converting Japan. Both enterprises,
the material and the spiritual, seem to have been organised
about the same time. A ship was loaded with articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
likely to be in demand in Japan, and Francis Xavier
embarked in another vessel, with the Japanese refugee
and a number of Jesuit priests as missionaries.</p>

<p>The vessels in due course arrived at Bungo, and both
priests and traders were cordially, not to say enthusiastically,
received. Foreigners were evidently not then
excluded from Japan, and no objection whatever was
made to the Christian propaganda in any part of the
country. The efforts of the Jesuit missionaries were
crowned with remarkable success. All ranks and classes,
from priest to peasant, embraced the Catholic faith.
Churches, schools, convents, and monasteries sprang up
all over the country. The only opposition came from the
Bonzes, or native priests, who felt their influence and
power declining. They appealed to the Emperor to
banish the Roman Catholic priests, but the imperial edict
simply was, &ldquo;Leave the strangers in peace.&rdquo; For forty
years or thereabouts Catholicism not only flourished but
was triumphant. Indeed, a Japanese mission of three
princes was despatched to Pope Gregory XIII. laden
with valuable presents. The arrival of this mission was
acclaimed as a veritable triumph throughout Catholic
Europe. By a stroke of irony its advent there was almost
contemporaneous with not only the overthrow but the
almost total extinction of Christianity in Japan. The
edict for the banishment of the missionaries was published
in 1587. It was followed by persecutions, martyrdoms,
and the rasing of all the Christian churches and buildings&mdash;the
destruction, in a word, of Christianity in Japan. This
was in due course followed by not only the expulsion of
all foreigners from the country&mdash;with the exception of the
Dutch, who were allowed to have a factory at Nagasaki&mdash;but
the enactment of a law, rigidly observed for two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and a half centuries, that no Japanese should leave his
country on any pretence whatever, and no foreigner be
permitted to land therein. Prior to this edict the Japanese
had been enterprising sailors and had extended their
voyages to many distant lands. What, it might be asked,
was the reason of or occasion for this violent change in
the attitude of the Japanese to Christianity and the presence
of Europeans in their midst? It is impossible, at
this length of time, to arrive at a correct answer to this
question, largely mixed up as it has been with the <i>odium
theologicum</i>. We have been told that the result was
greatly or altogether due to the pride, arrogance, and
avarice of the Roman Catholic priests; to the pretensions
of the Pope, which came to be regarded with suspicion by
the feudatory princes of Japan, as also to the cupidity
and cunning of the traders. How far any or all of these
alleged causes were responsible for the change in Japanese
opinion I shall not venture to pronounce. Suffice it to
remark that, whatever the cause, there must have been
some powerful, impelling influence at work to induce the
nation not only to cast out the stranger within its gates,
but to exclude him for two and a half centuries, and veto
any inhabitant of Japan leaving its shores and thus being
brought into contact with, and stand the chance of being
contaminated by, the foreigner. We may regret the
destruction of Christianity in Japan, but at the same
time we may, I think, accept the fact that the uprising
of Japan against the foreigner at the close of the sixteenth
century was simply the result of the gorge which
had arisen in the nation against the foreigner&rsquo;s manners,
methods, and morals, his trampling underfoot of national
prejudices and ideas, his cupidity, his avarice, his cruelty,
his attempt to impose on Japanese civilisation a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
veneer which it did not desire and deemed it was much
better without. It must be remembered that the missionaries
and the traders had a common nationality, and that
the Japan of the sixteenth century did not find it possible
to differentiate between them.</p>

<p>Down to the nineteenth century we have to rely for our
knowledge of Japan and the Japanese on the narratives
of the few travellers who managed to visit that country
more or less by stealth, or from the information derived
from Europeans serving in the Dutch factory at Nagasaki.
Every Englishman has heard of Will Adams and his
Japanese wife, but though his career was romantic and
interesting it has added but little to our knowledge of
Japan at the time of his visit thereto. In 1727 Dr. Kaemfer&rsquo;s
work on Japan was published. Kaemfer had been
physician to the Dutch factory at Nagasaki, and, accordingly,
had some opportunities of studying Japanese life
and character. His book in the original form is rare, but
I am glad to say that a cheap edition, a reprint of the
English edition produced by the Royal Society in 1727,
has recently been published in this country. Kaemfer&rsquo;s
work is spoiled and its utility or reliability largely impaired
by the fanciful theories put forward by the author
respecting the origin of the Japanese. Much of his information
is, of course, mere hearsay, and a great deal of it,
by the light of what we now know, is not only misleading
but nonsensical. A considerable amount of space
is devoted by Kaemfer to chimerical animals, and
he dilates upon the awful sanctity that surrounds the
person of the Emperor. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;such
a Holiness ascribed to all the parts of his Body that he
dares not cut off neither his hair, nor his beard, nor his
nails. However, lest he should grow too dirty, they may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
clean him in the night when he is asleep; because they
say that what is taken from his Body at that time had
been stolen from him, and that such a theft does not
prejudice his Holiness or Dignity.&rdquo; In a notice of this
new edition of Kaemfer&rsquo;s work I have seen it asserted
that the book is the foundation of nearly all that was
known or written of Japan till the last twenty-five years.
How such a statement as this came to be published I
quite fail to comprehend. There was plenty of literature
in reference to Japan far more reliable than Kaemfer&rsquo;s
whimsical &ldquo;yarns&rdquo; at a much earlier period than twenty-five
years back. Sir Rutherford Alcock&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Capital of
the Tycoon&rdquo; was, I think, published in 1863. Sir Rutherford
was the first resident British Minister in Japan, and
his book remains a stirring and, making allowance for the
author&rsquo;s prejudices on various matters, on the whole a
vivid picture of Japan as it was in the early sixties.
Alcock&rsquo;s book was followed by many others, and twenty-five
years ago the world was so far from being dependent
on Kaemfer for its knowledge of Japan that, as I have
said, it had even then quite a library of recent and reliable
books in regard to that country.</p>

<p>Following Kaemfer, a little later in the eighteenth century,
a Swedish physician, Thunberg by name, who also
had been attached to the Dutch factory at Nagasaki, wrote
a book undoubtedly interesting and of great value. That
country, he remarks, is &ldquo;in many respects a singular
country, and with regard to customs and institutions
totally different from Europe, or, I had almost said,
from any other part of the world. Of all the nations that
inhabit the three largest parts of the globe, the Japanese
deserve to rank the first, and to be compared with the
Europeans; and although in many points they must yield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the palm to the latter, yet in various other respects they
may with great justice be preferred to them. Here,
indeed, as well as in other countries, are found both useful
and pernicious establishments, both rational and absurd
institutions; yet still we must admire the steadiness
which constitutes the national character, the immutability
which reigns in the administration of their laws and in the
exercise of their public functions, the unwearied assiduity
of this nation to do and to promote what is useful, and
a hundred other things of a similar nature. That so
numerous a people as this should love so ardently and
so universally (without even a single exception to the
contrary) their native country, their Government, and each
other&mdash;that the whole country should be, as it were,
enclosed, so that no native can get out, nor foreigner
enter in, without permission&mdash;that their laws should have
remained unaltered for several thousand years&mdash;and that
justice should be administered without partiality or respect
of persons&mdash;that the Governments can neither become
despotic nor evade the laws in order to grant pardons or
do other acts of mercy&mdash;that the monarch and all his
subjects should be clad alike in a particular national dress&mdash;that
no fashions should be adopted from abroad, nor new
ones invented at home&mdash;that no foreign war should have
been waged for centuries past&mdash;that a great variety of
religious sects should live in peace and harmony together&mdash;that
hunger and want should be almost unknown, or at
least known but seldom,&mdash;all this must appear improbable,
and to many as impossible as it is strictly true, and
deserving of the utmost attention.&rdquo; He goes on to say,
&ldquo;If the laws in this country are rigid, the police are
equally vigilant, while discipline and good order are
scrupulously observed. The happy consequences of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
are extremely visible and important, for hardly any
country exhibits fewer instances of vice. And as no
respect whatever is paid to persons, and at the same time
the laws preserve their pristine and original purity, without
any alterations, explanations, and misconstructions,
the subjects not only imbibe, as they grow up, an infallible
knowledge of what ought or ought not to be done, but are
likewise enlightened by the example and irreproachable
conduct of their superiors in age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most crimes are punished with death&mdash;a sentence which
is inflicted with less regard to the magnitude of the crime
than to the audacity of the attempt to transgress the
hallowed laws of the empire, and to violate justice, which
together with religion they consider as the most sacred
things in the whole land. Fines and pecuniary mulcts
they regard as equally repugnant to justice and reason, as
the rich are thereby freed from all punishment&mdash;a procedure
which to them appears the height of absurdity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the towns it often happens that the inhabitants of
a whole street are made to suffer for the malpractice of a
single individual, the master of a house for the faults of
his domestics, and parents for those of their children, in
proportion to the share they may have had in the transaction.
In Europe, which boasts a purer religion and a
more enlightened philosophy, we very rarely see those
punished who have debauched and seduced others, never
see parents and relatives made to suffer for neglecting the
education of their children and kindred, at the same time
that these heathens see the justice and propriety of such
punishment.&rdquo; Dealing with agriculture, the Swedish
physician remarked: &ldquo;Agriculture is in the highest esteem
with the Japanese, insomuch that (the most barren and untractable
mountains excepted) one sees here the surface of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the earth cultivated all over the country, and most of the
mountains and hills up to their very tops. Neither rewards
nor encouragements are necessary in a country where the
tillers of the ground are considered as the most useful
class of citizens and where they do not groan under
various oppressions, which in other countries have hindered,
and ever must hinder, the progress of agriculture. The
duties paid by the farmer of his corn in kind are indeed
very heavy, but in other respects he cultivates his land
with greater freedom than the lord of a manor in Sweden.
He is not hindered two days together at a time, in consequence
of furnishing relays of horses, by which he perhaps
earns a groat and often returns with the loss of his horses;
he is not dragged from his field and plough to transport a
prisoner or a deserter to the next castle; nor are his time
and property wasted in making roads, building bridges,
almshouses, parsonage-houses, and magazines. He knows
nothing of the impediments and inconveniences which
attend the maintenance and equipments of horses and foot
soldiers. And what contributes still more to his happiness,
and leaves sufficient scope for his industry in cultivating
his land is this&mdash;that he has only one master, viz., his feudal
lord, without being under the commands of a host of
masters, as with us. No parcelling out of the land forbids
him to improve to the least advantage the portion he possesses,
and no right of commonage, belonging to many,
prevents each from deriving profit from his share. All are
bound to cultivate their land, and if a husbandman cannot
annually cultivate a certain portion of his fields he forfeits
them, and another who can is at liberty to cultivate them.
Meadows are not to be met with in the whole country; on
the contrary, every spot of ground is made use of either
for corn-fields or else for plantations of esculent-rooted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
vegetables: so that the land is neither wasted upon
extensive meadows for the support of cattle and saddle-horses,
nor upon large and unprofitable plantations of
tobacco; nor is it sown with seed for any other still less
necessary purpose; which is the reason that the whole
country is very thickly inhabited and populous, and can
without difficulty give maintenance to all its innumerable
inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us now take a step, a long step, forward in time
from the Swedish physician relating his impressions in
the seventeenth century, to an American in the eighteenth
century delivering his opinions on Japan and the Japanese
as viewed from the American standpoint at that period.
&ldquo;The sitter is the same, and, what is more, he sits on his
heels to-day just as his grandfather did to Thunberg, yet
it is hard to see any points of resemblance&mdash;a lesson to all
theologians and politicians who still indulge the dreams that
uniformity of opinion on the plainest matters of fact and
observation can ever be attained among men, however
honest and conscientious they may be in their efforts after
unity. The Chinese proverb with more wisdom declares,
&lsquo;Truth is one, but opinions are many.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All officials serve in pairs, as spies upon each other,
and this pervades the entire polity of Japan. It is a
government of espionage. Everybody is watched. No
man knows who are the secret spies around him, even
though he may be and is acquainted with those that are
official. The emperors themselves are not exempt;
governors, grand councillors, vassal princes, all are under
the eye of an everlasting unknown police. This wretched
system is even extended to the humblest of the citizens.
Every town is divided into collections of five families, and
every member of such a division is personally responsible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for the conduct of the others; everything which occurs,
therefore, out of the ordinary course in any one of these is
instantly reported by the other four to save themselves
from censure. The Ziogoon (Tycoon) has his minions
about the Mikado and the Grand Council have theirs about
the Ziogoon. And the cowardice engendered by such
ceaseless distrust necessarily leads to cruelty in penalties.
When an official has offended, or even when in his
department there has been any violation of law, although
beyond his power of prevention, so sure is he of the
punishment of death, that he anticipates it by ripping up
his own body rather than be delivered over to the
executioner and entailing disgrace and ruin on all his
family. There cannot under such a system be anything
like judicious legislation founded on enquiry and adapted
to the ever-varying circumstances of life. As Government
functionaries they lie and practise artifice to save themselves
from condemnation by the higher powers: it is
their vocation. As private gentlemen they are frank,
truthful, and hospitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a further step and coming down to the year
1877, I have before me, as I write, the private letter of a
naval officer of an impressionable age visiting Japan for
the first time and giving his opinions thereof, at a period
when Japan was just beginning to feel really at work
the distinct influences of Western civilisation&mdash;the beginning,
in fact, of the extraordinary metamorphosis which
has been witnessed of recent years. He remarks: &ldquo;Probably
to the traveller seeking the marvellous and desiring
the beautiful, there is no more interesting country to pay a
visit to than Japan. In something under a decade that
country astonished, and, at first, rather amused the civilised
world by emerging from the acme of barbarism to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
extremes of civilisation. It was but a very few years ago
that a foreigner could not land in the country unless
accompanied by a Government escort. But now that is
all changed. The foreigner is welcomed, his habits and
religion are not alone tolerated but respected; his dress is
copied to an extreme that indeed proves imitation to be
the sincerest flattery, and but for the olive complexion,
flat nose and dark hair, a Japanese gentleman of the period
is very little different from his English contemporary.
There is a tendency I find among a good many persons,
whose ideas on the subject of race and geography are
slightly mixed, to confound the Japanese with the Chinese,
and to imagine that the two names indicate no greater
difference than at present exist between an Englishman
and an Irishman. The fact, however, is that a greater
difference exists among these two nationalities than can be
either imagined or described, and, considering their contiguity,
it is indeed surprising that they have scarcely
a habit or a pursuit in common. The mind of the modern
Japanese is progressive and acquisitive. The mind of the
Chinaman of the nineteenth century, as far as he allows it
to be seen, is as torpid and retrogressive as his ancestors
of the Confucian period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to the year 1868 Japan was governed jointly by a
Tycoon and a Mikado together with a council of the
Daimios, or great feudal princes, in whose hands all real
power rested. The spiritual sovereign was the Mikado,
nominally the chief ruler, the Tycoon being considered his
first subject. All enactments required his sanction. The
office of the Tycoon was hereditary and he gradually
absorbed all the powers of the State. In 1868 a revolution
occurred which culminated in the overthrow of the spiritual
head and the seating of the Tycoon on the throne as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
hereditary prince with the title of Mikado. There is now
no such person as a Tycoon in Japan. The insurrection
of 1868 also saw the downfall of the Daimios or feudal
princes of Japan. These princes had each standing armies
of their own, and administered justice in their own territories.
Their retainers were the famous two-sworded men
so long a terror to Europeans, and who strongly objected
to any intercourse with foreigners, probably foreseeing its
inevitable result. In 1868 the whole of these ferocious
men were disarmed, and a standing army modelled on the
French fashion established for the defence of the Empire.
The Japanese Navy was organised about the same time by
an English officer, and at first consisted of a few obsolete
American and English men-of-war. That, however, is
now a thing of the past, the Japanese Government having
during the past few years spent many millions in purchasing
modern ironclads and other vessels of the most approved
type, and the Japanese Navy bids fair before long to become
a power in the Far East.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Concerning the oft-debated question of Japanese
morality I can say little. Their ideas on the subject are,
to put it mildly, somewhat lax, and would no doubt shock
any one strongly imbued with morality as it is in vogue
(theoretically) in European countries. That there is not
that privacy between the sexes which prevails in other
countries may be indicated by the fact that men and
women make their ablutions together in the public wash-houses.
Nevertheless the Japanese have a code of morality
peculiar to themselves, and any infidelity on the part of a
woman to her husband is punished with severity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great drawback to the prosperity of Japan is a
matter that prevails in some more ancient civilised lands,
viz., an enormous issue of paper-money. Young Japan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
finding it easy to print notes to pay its obligations, printed
them to the extent of twenty millions sterling in all sizes
from 5 cents to 100 dollars. The consequence is that this
paper-money has depreciated in value to the extent of
15 per cent. The Government, however, have seen their
mistake, and are gradually calling it in, and have established
a very fine mint with a gold and silver coinage. Insurrections
have also been a drag on Japan in its progress. The
Prince of Satsuma, one of the most powerful of the ancient
Daimios, has never acknowledged the present system of
government and has periodically rebelled against it. This
year a serious rebellion broke out at Kagoshima, and was
not quelled without great loss of life and a heavy expenditure.
His followers behaved with great fanaticism, many
of them loading themselves with gunpowder rushing into
the midst of the enemy and setting fire to the powder,
killing themselves by so doing, but also, to the admiration
of their less ardent comrades, killing numbers of the
enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Against no ancient custom has the Japanese Government
more set its face than tattooing. Any persons in
Japan now either allowing themselves to be tattooed or
performing the operation on any one else are liable to
imprisonment. Blacking the teeth, a custom prevalent
among the women on being married, is rapidly dying out,
being discouraged by the authorities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The glimpses of Japan shown us by Thunberg and the
American I have quoted prove clearly enough, even were
it not amplified by a host of other testimony I have not
space to refer to, that the Japan of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
eighteenth, and early part of the nineteenth
centuries was a highly civilised country in which law and
order reigned supreme, where respect for authority was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
marked, the standard of comfort, if not high, was at
any rate sufficient, the domestic relations and family life
were almost ideal, clean living was the custom, crime was
at a minimum, education was universal, amusements were
plentiful, the artistic feeling and instincts were not the cult
of a class but were shared by the common people. This
was the nation, self-contained and self-satisfied, that some
persons, like the young naval officer from whom I have
quoted, gravely affirm to have been steeped in barbarism
until it came under Western influences and went in for
frock-coats and silk hats for the men, Paris costumes for
the women, and an Army and Navy on European lines. If
these be the factors which constitute civilisation I admit
that Japan has only recently been civilised. Being of
opinion, however, that civilisation does not consist in costumery,
but is a refining and educating influence, I prefer
to regard Japan as a country of more ancient civilisation
than Great Britain, which has of recent years determined
to tack on to that civilisation some Western manners and
customs and facilities. Many of Japan&rsquo;s greatest thinkers,
a few Western philosophers who can look beyond a
costume, the telegraph or the telephone, are strongly of
opinion that in the process of modern development Japan
has not improved either morally or materially, and that,
regarded through the dry light of philosophy, her pretensions
to be considered a highly civilised nation were
greater half a century back than they are at the present
moment. Upon that matter my readers must form their
own opinion. It is a question, the answer to which largely
depends upon the point of view from which it is regarded
and the factors taken into or left out of account.</p>

<p>In the first year of the Meiji (1868) the Emperor, in an
edict, laid down clearly and concisely the lines on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he and his advisers had determined that Japan should for
the future be governed. &ldquo;The old uncivilised way shall
be replaced by the eternal principles of the universe.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The best knowledge shall be sought throughout the
world so as to promote the imperial welfare.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
eternal principles of the universe&rdquo; is a resonant phrase
needing interpretation. The rulers of Japan to-day, if they
were interrogated on the subject, would probably reply that
the record of Japan for over thirty-eight years past is the
practical interpretation of the Emperor&rsquo;s cryptic utterance.
Be that as it may, the ink was hardly dry on the Imperial
edict before Japan laid herself out with earnestness, not to
say enthusiasm, to carry into effect the principles enunciated
in the edict. The whole country was quickly in a positive
ferment of energy. The brightest intellects among its
youth were despatched to foreign lands to acquire knowledge
and wisdom to be applied at home in due course,
education was taken in hand, so also was the reorganisation
of the Army and Navy, and railways, telegraphs, and various
other accessories of European civilisation were introduced
into the country. Japan, in a word, became quickly transformed
and, being unable any longer to keep the foreigner
out, she determined to utilise him and in the future fight
him, should fighting be necessary, with his own weapons,
intellectual rather than material, but not omitting the

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE COUNTRY&mdash;ITS PHYSICAL FEATURES&mdash;PRODUCTS&mdash;FAUNA&mdash;FLORA,
ETC.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Empire of Japan (a corruption of Nippon, the
native name) is composed of four large islands&mdash;Honshiu,
Shikoku, Kiushiu, and Yesso, besides some
thousands of smaller isles. The Kurile Isles, north of
Yesso, and in the neighbourhood of Kamschatka, have
been incorporated in the Empire since 1875, and the Loo-Choo
Islands, some 500 miles south-west of Japan&rsquo;s
southern extremity, since 1876. The great island of
Formosa, situated off the coast of China, was ceded to
Japan as the outcome of the Chino-Japanese War in 1895,
while as the result of the recent conflict with Russia, Japan
has obtained back the southern half of the large island of
Sakhalin, which formerly entirely belonged to her, as well
as Port Arthur and Dalny on the mainland, not to speak
of the preponderating influence she has obtained in Korea,
which is now practically under the suzerainty of Japan.
The population of the Empire according to the last census
was about forty-seven millions, and, like that of Great
Britain, it is annually increasing. The proximity of Japan
to the Asiatic Continent, despite the lessons in geography
which the late war afforded, is not, I think, generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
understood. The nearest point of the Japanese coast
is only 100 miles distant from Korea, while between
the two lies the important island of Tsu-shima, which
Japan found so useful as a strategic position during the
war with Russia. The island of Sakhalin, the southern
portion of which, as I have said, has lately passed into the
possession of Japan, is about 20 miles distant from the
northern part of Yesso, while at some places the island
is only separated from the Russian mainland by 5 or 6
miles of water. The distance between Hakodate, in Yesso,
and the great Russian port of Vladivostock is somewhere
about 200 miles. This contiguity of Japan to the Asiatic
Continent has already had a marked effect on the politics
of the world, and in the future, if I mistake not, is likely
to be a preponderating factor therein. The area of Japan
is about half as large again as that of the United Kingdom.
The southern extremity of the country is in latitude 31&deg;&nbsp;N.,
the northern in latitude 45&frac12;&deg;&nbsp;N.</p>

<p>The Japanese islands are undoubtedly of volcanic origin,
and many of the volcanoes in the country are still more or
less active. The general conformation of the land leads
one to suppose that the islands are the summits of mountain
ranges which some thousands of years back had their bases
submerged by the rising of the sea or else had by degrees
settled down beneath the surface of the ocean. The general
characteristic of the country is mountainous, and only
about one-sixth of the total area is in cultivation. Fuji-yama,
the loftiest mountain, for which the Japanese have
a peculiar veneration and which has been immortalised in
the art of the country, has an altitude of 12,730 feet. The
next in height, Mount Mitake, ascends some 9,000 feet,
and there are many others of 5,000 feet or more. Japan
has from time to time been ravaged by, and indeed still is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
subject to, terrible earthquakes. These dire calamities
seem to recur at regular intervals. The Japanese islands
appear to be in the centre of great volcanic disturbances&mdash;a
fact which probably accounts for those seismic outbreaks
which periodically devastate considerable tracts of the
country and cause tremendous havoc to life and property.
The written records, extending back some 1,400 or 1,500
years, clearly prove that earthquakes even more terrible in
their effects than any that have taken place in recent times
were of frequent occurrence. It is, of course, possible that
these records may be inaccurate or have been largely
exaggerated, but they at any rate tend to show that those
great cosmic forces which are popularly termed earthquakes
have been constantly at work in Japan ever since any
written records have been preserved and no doubt long
anterior to that time.</p>

<p>As the islands are narrow and mountainous there are no
great rivers and none available for important navigation.
None of the rivers exceed 200 miles in length. Although
Japan is situated much further south than Great Britain,
its northern extremity being in about the same latitude as
Cornwall, its climate is, on the whole, not unlike that of
this country. Of course the climate of such a mountainous
country and one extending over 14 degrees of latitude
varies considerably. That of the island of Yesso, for
example, is in winter rigorous to a degree, a fact in some
measure caused by a cold current which flows down its
eastern shores from the Sea of Okohotsk. Professor Rein,
who has given great attention to the matter of the Japanese
climate, has remarked in reference thereto: &ldquo;The climate
of Japan reflects the characteristics of that of the neighbouring
continent, and exhibits like that two great annual
contrasts&mdash;a hot, damp summer and a cold relatively dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
winter; these two seasons lie under the sway of the
monsoons, but the neighbouring seas weaken the effects of
these winds and mitigate their extremes in such a manner
that neither the summer heat nor the cold of winter attain
the same height in Japan as in China at the same latitudes.
Spring and autumn are extremely agreeable seasons; the
oppressive summer heat does not last long, and in winter
the contrast between the nightly frosts and the midday
heat, produced by considerable insulation but still more by
the raw northerly winds, causes frequent chills, though the
prevailing bright sky makes the season of the year much
more endurable than in many other regions where the
winter cold is equal. As a fact the climate of Japan
agrees very well with most Europeans, so that people have
already begun to look upon certain localities as climatic
watering-places where the inhabitant of Hong Kong and
Shanghai can find refuge from the oppressive heat of
summer and invigorate his health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mean annual temperature of Tokio is about 56&deg;.
The lowest temperature is in January or February, when
the thermometer seldom falls below 25&deg;, the highest in
August, when it sometimes rises to 95&deg; or 100&deg; in the
shade, the average being 82&deg;. The Japanese suffer a good
deal from the effects of the wintry weather, bronchial,
chest, and rheumatic affections being prevalent. The
dwellings of the people, somewhat flimsy in construction
as they are, are not well adapted to withstand the effects
of a low temperature. On the whole the people must be
pronounced to be extremely healthy&mdash;a fact probably due
to their scrupulous cleanliness, to the excellent ventilation
of their houses, and, as regards those living in the towns,
to the wide and well-kept streets where nothing offensive
is allowed to remain. The country has, however, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
time to time been subject to epidemics introduced from
without, cholera and the plague having more than once
carried death throughout the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<p>Those circular storms known as cyclones in the Indian
Ocean and typhoons in further Eastern seas have from time
to time wrought great devastation in Japan. Fortunately
these revolving storms are of brief duration, and in the
neighbourhood of Japan they do not so frequently occur
as in the China Sea.</p>

<p>Japan is well provided with good harbours, that of
Nagasaki in especial being one of the finest in the world.
Sheltered completely by lofty and beautiful hills, with
deep water throughout, it is an ideal anchorage. Until
recently foreign trade was confined to the treaty ports;
but as the country has now been completely thrown open,
there is no doubt that the many fine harbours which Japan
possesses, and which so far have hardly been utilised at all,
will in due course become the centres of great commercial
activity. The Inland Sea&mdash;the beautiful Mediterranean of
Japan&mdash;abounds with excellent anchorages, most of which
have hitherto been only entered by an occasional junk.</p>

<p>Regarding the mineral wealth of the country, it is impossible
to speak with any precision. It was not until
after the Revolution of 1868 that the mining industry
assumed importance in Japan. At first the Government
itself owned several mines, but these were not financially
successful, and they were after a time disposed of to private
owners. The old mining regulations have recently been
superseded by a new mining law. In accordance with this
the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce is the official
who permits, approves, cancels, or suspends the right of
mining, whether permanently or on trial. I may, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
at once remark that the Japanese Government has not
up to the present held out much encouragement to the
speculative prospector. Gold is believed to exist in considerable
quantities in Yesso, and as a matter of fact,
although the amount mined is still small, it is annually
increasing. Coal is abundant in various parts of the
country and the mines are extensively worked. In 1903
there were over ten million tons of coal produced, and the
quantity is at the present time assuredly very much greater.
The coal is not of such a good quality as either Welsh or
North Country, but there is a large and growing demand
for it in the East, and coal is undoubtedly a highly important
part of Japan&rsquo;s latent wealth. Copper, a metal
which is in increasing demand, exists in Japan in enormous
quantities, and she promises at no very far-distant date to
be the chief copper-producing country of the world. Iron
and sulphur are also found, and there are many other
minerals, some of which are more or less worked. The
Japanese Mining Law, it may be interesting to relate, recognises
the following minerals and mineral ores, which may
accordingly be taken as existing in the country: Gold,
silver, copper, lead, tin, hematite, antimony, quicksilver, zinc,
iron, manganese and arsenic, plumbago, coal, kerosene,
sulphur, bismuth, phosphorus, peat.</p>

<p>Whatever the mineral wealth of Japan&mdash;and the extent
and variety thereof are probably yet not fully realised&mdash;there
can be no question as to the value of its arboreal products.
The lacquer-tree (<i>rhus vernicifera</i>), which furnishes
the well-known Japanese lacquer, the paper mulberry, the
elm, oak, maple, bamboo, camphor, and many other descriptions
of trees, grow in abundance. The forests of Japan
cover nearly 60 per cent. of the land. For some years after
the Revolution there was a reduction in the wooded area,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
nearly four million acres having been cleared for occupation.
Of late years, however, forestry has been scientifically
taken in hand, and about one and a half million acres have
been replanted in districts which have not been found suitable
for farming. The climate of Japan varies so greatly
that there is a corresponding variety in its trees. About
eight hundred kinds of forest trees are suitable for cultivation
in Japan, varying from the palm and the bamboo to the
fir and many other trees with which we are familiar in this
country.</p>

<p>The Japanese are above all things an agricultural people.
The tobacco plant, the tea shrub, potatoes, rice, wheat,
barley, millet, cotton, rape, and many cereals other than
those I have mentioned are extensively cultivated. The
great mass of the people of Japan live on the land, and
though I think the tendency, as in Great Britain, is for the
large towns to magnetically draw the dwellers in the
country, nevertheless agriculture is still held in high esteem,
and the peasant is content to dwell on the land and live by
it. Rice is the staple food of the people, and it is grown
everywhere; indeed the yearly harvest of it affects the
Japanese economy quite as much as, if not even more than,
the wheat crop does that of Europe. The Japanese peasant
is almost as dependent on rice as the Irish peasant used to
be on potatoes. The water, so necessary for irrigating the
land, is supplied by the streams and rivulets which are
plentiful in the country. The Japanese agriculturist has
long been famous for the admirable manner in which he
keeps and tills his farm. The fields are clean as regards
weeds, and order and neatness are perceptible everywhere.
The labour is almost entirely manual, and men, women,
and children all take part in the work.</p>

<p>Fruit is abundant in Japan, but it is for the most part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of an inferior quality. Grapes, apples, pears, plums,
peaches, chestnuts, persimmons, oranges, figs, lemons,
citrons, melons, and wild strawberries are all grown, but
except as regards the grapes I cannot speak in laudatory
terms of Japanese fruit. The flowers of many fruit trees
seem more appreciated than the fruit itself.</p>

<p>The floral kingdom is rich, beautiful and varied. Probably
in no other part of the world are flowers so greatly
appreciated as in Japan. They enter largely into various
popular festivals. The Japanese, as most people know,
excel in the art of gardening and the dwarfing of trees and
shrubs. The flower vendor is a familiar sight, and there is
never any lack of buyers. The poorest householder will
do without anything almost rather than deprive himself of
flowers. These enter largely into the religious services of
the people, and are also extensively placed on the graves
of the departed. Flowers, indeed, play an important part
in the lives of the Japanese. Japan has long been famous
for the great number of its evergreens. A large number
of the plants growing wild are of this class, so that even
in winter the land has not the bare appearance characteristic
of European countries at that time of the year.
Coniferous plants are abundant, many of them being
peculiar to Japan.</p>

<p>The coasts abound with fish of an excellent quality, and
this, with rice, forms the staple diet of the people. Tea is,
as I have said, largely cultivated, and indeed may be regarded
as the national beverage. It has been cultivated
in the country for over two thousand years. It is an
article of faith in Japan that tea strengthens the body. It
is drunk everywhere and at all times, without either milk
or sugar&mdash;the true way, I think, in which to appreciate
its flavour. The tea-house in Japan occupies the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
position as the public-house in this country, but it has
many advantages over the latter. In the towns and some
other parts of Japan, sak&eacute;&mdash;a spirit distilled from rice&mdash;is
drunk, and when the Japanese has to any extent been
Europeanised or brought into contact with Europeans, he
affects a taste for European varieties of alcohol. On the
whole, however, the people are distinctly a sober race.</p>

<p>The principal towns are Tokio, the capital, with a
population of about one and half millions, Osaka, having
a population nearly as great, Kyoto, the ancient capital,
Nagoya, Kob&eacute;, Yokohama, and Nagasaki. Yokohama may
be regarded as the European headquarters; indeed it is
largely a European town, while Nagasaki has more than
any other been under European influences, the Dutch
having, as I have already stated, had a factory there, in the
suburb of Decima, continuously ever since the expulsion
of foreigners from the country in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Railway communication in Japan is a subject upon
which much might be written. For many years there was
only one line in the country&mdash;that between Yokohama and
Tokio, about 22 miles in length. At the present time there
are some 4,500 miles of railway open, and extensions are
either in progress or in contemplation. Of the lines now
being worked, about one-third are the property of the
Government, the rest having been constructed by private
enterprise. This dual system of ownership has its disadvantages,
and it will doubtless not be permitted to last.
Railway construction has already had a considerable effect
on the opening up of the country, and as the construction
is extended the development of Japan will doubtless
proceed in an increasing ratio.</p>

<p>The scenery of Japan has provided a theme for so many
pens that I do not feel inclined to do more than refer to it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in passing. Much of the scenery is sublime but, truth to
tell, its beauty, or perhaps it would be more correct to say
the effect thereof on the sightseer, has been somewhat
marred of recent years by the influx of those persons
colloquially known as &ldquo;globe trotters,&rdquo; the railway extensions
to which I have referred, and the erection of large
hotels run on European lines. Nikko, the incomparable,
with its glorious scenery and its still more glorious temples,
the meandering Daynogawa, the beauteous Lake Chiuzenji,
on which a quarter of a century or so ago a European
provided with a passport and having his headquarters at
a neighbouring tea-house might gaze at his leisure, and
meditate in a glorious silence broken only by the sound of
the ripples of the water or the cry of the birds from the
neighbouring woods, all are now vulgarised. The personally
conducted tourist is there and very much in evidence.
He wanders carelessly, often contemptuously, through the
ancient temples, regarding temples, scenery, river, lakes,
merely as &ldquo;something to be done.&rdquo; The change was, I
suppose, inevitable, but the change is one that I think is in
some respects to be regretted. The tourist brings money
and spends it freely, and the country no doubt reaps the
advantage thereof, but the effect on the Japanese brought
into contact with the European under such conditions is
not, in my opinion, always, or often, beneficial.</p>

<p>I have not much to remark in regard to the fauna of Japan.
The domestic animals are comparatively few. The fact
of the inhabitants not eating animal food has led to their
paying little or no attention to the breeding of those
animals which are largely in request in foreign countries.
Horses, however, are fairly plentiful, though small. Japan,
as I have elsewhere remarked, has been handicapped in
the organisation of her cavalry by the lack of a proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
supply of suitable horses, and she has recently despatched
a commission to Europe to effect purchases with a view of
putting this matter right, and improving the breed of
horses in the county. Oxen and cows were till recently
entirely, and are still largely, used for purposes of draught
only. Sheep and pigs have been introduced from abroad,
but they have not been generally distributed, and in many
parts of Japan have never been seen.</p>

<p>The wild animals of Japan are neither numerous nor
important. The black bear and the wolf still exist, chiefly
in the Northern Island, but it is certain that at no far-distant
date they will, unless artificially preserved, go the
way of all wild animals in civilised countries. The red-faced
monkey is there, the only kind found in Japan, and
snakes exist, but they are for the most part harmless. The
art of the country will have familiarised Europeans with
the presence of the crane and the stork, which play such a
prominent part therein. Indeed the wild birds of the
country are more numerous than the animals. I am not
aware whether geological research in Japan has been
sufficiently extensive or systematic to ascertain whether,
and if so what, any species of animals have ever existed
there other than those at present found in the country. It
certainly is in some respects extraordinary that a country
so close to the Asiatic Continent and possessing such a
variety of climates should, as regards the animal kingdom
from the standpoint of the zoologist, be put down as
distinctly poor. The fact, or supposed fact, to which I have
previously referred, that the Japanese islands are the
summits of mountain ranges which many thousand years
ago had their bases submerged by the rising of the sea or
had gradually settled down beneath the surface of the ocean,
may, of course, account for the poverty of Japan in regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the animals therein. I must leave other pens than mine
to descant on that interesting if highly speculative matter.
Be that as it may, if the fauna of Japan is poor, the country
certainly makes up for it by the variety and magnificence
of its flora&mdash;a flora which deserves to be studied,
and which has done so much to brighten not only the
appearance of the country but the lives of its inhabitants.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE JAPANESE RACE AND ITS LANGUAGE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are, I have always thought, two ways in
which any race should be considered if it is
desired to form a correct idea in regard to it, viz., from
an ethnological and philological standpoint. No race
deserves to be closer studied in these matters than the
Japanese. Indeed, I am of opinion that it is impossible
to arrive at any clear or correct opinion concerning it
without having, however slightly, investigated its racial
descent and the language which, among Eastern dialects,
has so long been as great a puzzle to the philologist as
has Basque among the European languages. Respecting
the origin of the Japanese we know practically nothing&mdash;at
any rate nothing authentic. The native legends and
histories afford us neither guide nor clue in the matter.
These legends and histories tell us that the Japanese are
descended from the gods, but I am quite certain that the
modern Japanese receives that fact (?) with something
more than the proverbial grain of salt. According to the
old legend Ninigi-no-Nikoto was a god despatched by his
grandmother the Sun-goddess to take possession of Japan,
and the land was peopled by him and his entourage.
This god-man, it is stated, lived over 300,000 years; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
son, Hohoderni, attained to twice that period of longevity,
while a grandchild, Ugaya by name, reached the respectable
old age of 836,042 years. Ugaya was, it is stated, the
father of Jimmu, the first Emperor. It is not necessary to
seriously notice fables or legends or poetic imagery, or
whatever these tales may be deemed to be, although I may
remark that the divine descent of the sovereign of Japan
has, so far as I know, never been formally repudiated, and
it is still explicitly, if not implicitly, held.</p>

<p>Dr. Kaemfer, whose great work I have already referred
to, propounded therein the somewhat fanciful theory that
the Japanese are really the direct descendants of the
ancient Babylonians, and that their language &ldquo;is one of
those which Sacred Writ mentions the all-wise Providence
thought fit to infuse into the minds of the vain builders of
the Babylonian Tower.&rdquo; According to his theory, which
to me seems absolutely ludicrous, the Japanese came
through Persia, then along the shores of the Caspian Sea
and by the bank of the Oxus to its source. From there,
he suggests, they crossed China, descended the Amoor,
proceeded southwards to Korea, and found their way
across the intervening sea to the Japanese islands.
Another theory, which has found many supporters, is
that the Japanese are descended from the Ainos, the
hairy race still to be found in the island of Yesso. An
advocate of this view seeks to bolster up his faith by the
evidences of an aboriginal race still to be found in the
relics of the Stone Age in Japan. &ldquo;Flint arrows and spear-heads,&rdquo;
he remarks, &ldquo;hammers, chisels, scrapers, kitchen
refuse, and various other trophies are frequently excavated,
or may be found in the museum or in homes of private
persons. Though covered with the soil for centuries, they
seem as though freshly brought from an Aino hut in Yesso.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
In scores of striking instances the very peculiar ideas,
customs, and superstitions of both Japanese and Aino are
the same, or but slightly modified.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<a name="the_sweet_scent_of_the_cherry_blossom" id="the_sweet_scent_of_the_cherry_blossom"></a>
<img src="images/empire02.jpg" width="413" height="600"
alt="Three woman gather by cherry trees" />
</div>

<p class="caption">THE SWEET SCENT OF THE CHERRY BLOSSOM<br />

<small>FROM A PRINT BY HIROSHIGE</small></p>

<p>This seems to me to be no evidence at all. Flint
arrows, spear-heads, hammers, and so on are to be found
in every part of the world. Mankind all over the globe
seems to have evolved its civilisation, or what passes for
it, in very much the same way, viz., by process of experiment.
Another authority has asserted that the short,
round skull, the oblique eyes, the prominent cheek-bones,
the dark, black hair, and the scanty beard all proclaim
the Manchus and Koreans as the nearest congeners
of the Japanese. This authority considers it positive
that the latter are a Tungusic race, and that their own
traditions and the whole course of their history are incompatible
with any other conclusion than that Korea is
the route by which the immigrant tribes made their entry
into Kiushiu from their original Manchurian home. While
accepting this theory with some reservations, I may remark
that I altogether fail to see what the &ldquo;whole course&rdquo; of
Japanese history has to do with the matter. Japanese
history, as I have previously observed, is almost altogether
legendary, and proves nothing except the credulity of
those who have accepted it as statements of fact. Ethnology,
I admit, is a most interesting field for speculation.
It is one in which the mind can positively run riot and
the imagination revel. The wildest theories have been put
forward in regard to many of the world&rsquo;s races, and philological
arguments of the thinnest possible kind have been
used to bolster them up. For example, one very able
writer on this matter has broached a theory respecting the
origin of the Japanese, and supported it by what seems to
be very plausible evidence. He assumes, on what grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
I know not, that there was a white race earlier in the field
of history than the Aryans, and that the seat of this white
race was in High Africa. That it was from Africa that
migrations were made to North, Central, and South
America, as well as to Egypt, and subsequently to
Babylonia and, apparently, to India. In due course,
according to this authority, Syria and Babylonia were
conquered by the Semites, while the Aryans became
masters of Europe, Asia Minor, and India. The suggestion
is that the conquerors of the Japanese islands
and the founders of the Japanese language and mythology
were of the Turano-African type. That these invaders
intermarried with a mixed short race, and that the new
dominating Japanese race maintained and propagated
their dialect of the language and their sect of the religion,
and displaced the pure natives. The same authority
suggests that when the Pacific route to America was
closed by the weakness of the Turano Africans and the
rising of cannibals and other savages (where did they rise
from?) the Japanese were isolated on the east. On their
west the Turano-African dynasties in China and Korea
fell, and were replaced by natives, the same series of events
taking place as in Egypt, Peru, Mexico, &amp;c. The principal
evidence in support of this somewhat startling theory is
the similarity between the words in use in Japanese and
in certain African languages. But if evidence of that
nature is to be accepted in proof of somewhat improbable
theories, it will be possible to prove almost anything in
regard to the origin of races. I utterly reject all these
far-fetched theories. Any unprejudiced man looking at
the Japanese, the Chinaman, and the Korean will have
no doubt whatever in his own mind as to their racial
affinity. Differences there most certainly are, just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there are between the Frenchman and the Englishman,
or even the Englishman and the Scotchman, but what
I may term the pronounced characteristics are the same&mdash;the
colour of the skin, the oblique eyes, the dark hair, and
the contour of the skull. These people, whatever the
present difference in their mental, moral, and physical
characteristics, have quite evidently all come from the
same stock. They are, in a word, Mongolians, and any
attempt to prove that one particular portion of this stock
is Turano-African, or something else equally absurd from
an ethnological point of view, seems to me to be positively
childish. There was probably originally a mixture of
races, Malay as well as others, which has had its effect on
the peculiar temperament of the Japanese as he is to-day
compared with the Chinaman.</p>

<p>Of course language cannot be left out of account in the
question of the racial origin of any people, and the Japanese
language has, as I have said, long been a puzzle for the
philologist. In the early times we are told the Japanese
had no written language. The language in use before the
opening up of communications with Korea and China
stood alone. Indeed there is only one language outside
Japan which has any affinity therewith, that is the language
of the inhabitants of the Loo-Choo Islands. Philologists
have excluded the language from the Aryan and Semitic
tongues, and included it in the Turanian group. It is said
to possess all the characteristics of the Turanian family
being agglutinated, that is to say, maintaining its roots in
their integrity without formative prefixes, poor in conjunctions,
and copious in the use of participles. It is uncertain
when alphabetical characters were introduced into Japan,
but it is believed to have happened when intercourse with
Korea was first opened about the commencement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Christian Era. The warrior Empress, Jungu-kogo, is said
to have carried away from Korea as many books as possible
after the successful invasion of that country. In the third
century the son of the Emperor Ojin learned to read
Chinese works, and henceforward the Chinese language
and literature seem to have been introduced into Japan.
A great impetus was given to the spread of Chinese
literature by the introduction of Buddhism and Buddhist
writings in the sixth century, and the effect thereof is now
apparent in the number of Chinese words in the Japanese
language. The question as to the origin of the earliest
written characters employed in Japan is one that has
produced, and probably will continue to produce, much
controversy. These are known as Shinji letters of the
God Age, but they have left no traces in the existing
alphabet. There is a remarkable difference between the
written and spoken dialects of Japan. The grammars of
the two are entirely different, and it is possible to speak
the language colloquially and yet not be able to read a
newspaper, book, or letter; while, on the other hand, it is
possible to know the written language thoroughly, and yet
be unable to carry on a conversation with a Japanese.
The spoken language, as a matter of fact, is not difficult
except in regard to the complicated construction of the
words. The difficulty is in reference to the written
language. There are really three modes or systems of
writing: the first consists of the use of the Chinese
characters, the second and third of two different alphabets.
Although the Japanese have adopted the Chinese characters
and learned to attach to them the same meaning
as obtains in China, the construction of sentences is sometimes
so totally different that it is difficult for a Chinaman
to read a book written by a Japanese in the Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
characters, while the Japanese cannot read Chinese books
unless he has specially studied Chinese. It is evident from
what I have said that it is difficult to obtain a complete
knowledge of the written language of Japan in its Chinese
form. There is a certain school of thought in Japan which
is enthusiastic for the replacement of the present complicated
system by the introduction of a Roman alphabet,
but I feel bound to say that this school has not made
much progress, and it is not likely to be successful.
Although the present system has its disadvantages, it
has its advantages likewise. The written characters are
those common to about 450 millions of the world&rsquo;s people,
and I think that the use of the Chinese characters in Japan
will be a factor of considerable importance in the future
history of the world, because I am convinced that Japan
is destined to exercise a preponderating influence in and
over China, and that the exercise of that influence will be
greatly facilitated by the written characters which both
nations have in common.</p>

<p>I may at once candidly confess that I have no theory to
broach in respect of the origin of the Japanese people or
the language that they speak. In such matters theorising
appears to me to be a pure waste of time. One has only
to look round the world as it is to-day, or for the matter of
that within the confines of one&rsquo;s own country, to see how
rapidly the people living for long periods in a certain part
of the country develop distinct characteristics not only in
physiognomy but in dialect. It is only the existence of
the printing press which has, so to speak, stereotyped the
languages of nations and prevented variations becoming
fixed, variations and dialects which in days prior to the
existence of printing presses were evolved into distinct
languages. Take the British Isles for example, any part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them, Yorkshire, Scotland, Ireland, London, and note the
difference between the spoken language of certain classes
and the language as printed in newspapers and books.
Given a nation isolated, or comparatively isolated, for many
hundreds of years, it is difficult to say to what extent its
language might be evolved or in what degree the few
chance visitors thereto may introduce words which are
readily adapted to or adopted in the language and influence
it for all time. Take, for example, a word which any
visitor to China or Japan must have heard over and over
again, viz., &ldquo;Joss,&rdquo; as applied to God. This is, as most
people know, simply a corruption of the Portuguese name
for the deity. I hope some philologist a few thousand
years hence who may trace that word to its original source
will not adduce therefrom that either the Chinese or the
Japanese sprang from a Latin race.</p>

<p>The most ancient Japanese writings date from the eighth
century. These are Japanese written in Chinese characters,
but the Chinese written language as also its literature and
the teachings of the great Chinese philosopher, Confucius,
are believed to have been introduced several hundreds of
years previously. This contact with and importation from
China undoubtedly had a marked effect in inducing what
I may term atrophy in the development of the Japanese
language as also the growth of its own literature, that is a
literature entirely devoid of Chinese influences. Indeed it
is impossible to speculate on what might have been the
development of Japan and in what direction that development
would have proceeded had she never come under the
influence of the Chinese language, literature, religion, and
artistic principles.</p>

<p>I have not the slightest doubt myself, as I have said
before, that the Japanese are of the same stock as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Chinese and Koreans. I have no theory in regard to the
origin of the Ainos, who are most likely the aboriginal
inhabitants. They are quite evidently a distinct race from
the Japanese proper, although of course there has been
some interbreeding between them.</p>

<p>The language of Japan naturally suggests some reference
to its literature, of which there is no lack, either ancient or
modern. I have dealt with this matter in some detail in a
subsequent chapter. The old literature of Japan is but
little known to Europeans, and probably most Europeans
would be incapable of appreciating or understanding it.
It abounds in verbal artifices, and the whole habits of life
and modes of thought and conception of things, material
and spiritual, of the Japanese of those days were so totally
different to those of the European as to render it almost
unintelligible to the latter. There are, however, scholars
who have waded through this literature as also through the
poetry of Japan and have found great delight therein. In
the process of translating an Oriental language, full of
depths of subtlety of thought and expressing Oriental ideas
in an Oriental manner, much, if not most, of its beauty and
charm must be lost. That is, I think, why the Japanese
prose and poetry when translated into English seem so
bald and lifeless. We know by experience that even a
European language loses in the process of translation which
is, except in very rare instances, a purely mechanical art.
How much more so must be the case in regard to an
Oriental language with its depths of hyperbole and replete
with imagery, idealism, and flowery illustrations.</p>

<p>I have referred to the literature of modern Japan, the
ephemeral literature, in a chapter on its newspaper press.
The modern literature, whether ephemeral or otherwise, is
distinctly not on Oriental lines. The influence of the West
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
permeates it. Distinctive Japanese literature is, I imagine,
a thing of the past, and I fear it will be less and less
studied as time goes on. Young Japan is a &ldquo;hustler,&rdquo; to
use a modern word, and it has no time and mayhap not
much inclination for what it perhaps regards as somewhat
effete matter. It thinks hurriedly and acts rapidly, and
it, accordingly, aspires to express its thoughts and ideas
through a medium which shall do so concisely and
effectively.</p>

<p>Whatever the origin of the Japanese race or the Japanese
language, whether the former came from the plains of
Babylon, the heights of Africa, or from some part of the
American Continent, or was evolved on the spot, one thing
is certain&mdash;that the Japanese race and the Japanese language
have been indelibly stamped on the world&rsquo;s history. The
ethnologist may still puzzle himself as to the origin of these
forty-seven millions of people and feel annoyed because he
cannot classify them to his own satisfaction. The philologist
may feel an equal or even a greater puzzle in reference
to their language. These are merely speculative matters
which may interest or amuse the man who has the time
for such pursuits, but they are, after all, of no great practical
importance. The future of a race is of more concern than
its past, and, whatever the origin of a language may have
been, if that language serves in the processes of development
to give expression to noble thoughts, whether in
prose or poetry, to voice the wisdom of the people, to
preach the gospel of human brotherhood, it matters little
how it was evolved or whence it came. It is because I
believe that the Japanese race and the Japanese language
have a great future before them in the directions I have
indicated that I have dealt but lightly, I hope none of my
readers will think contemptuously, with the theories that
have been put forward in reference to the origin of both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE RELIGIONS OF JAPAN, THEIR INFLUENCES
AND EFFECTS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>OST persons in this country if they were asked
what was the religion of the Japanese people would
probably answer Buddhism. As a matter of fact, though
Buddhism was introduced into Japan from Korea as far
back as 552 <small>A.D.</small>, it is not and never has been the preponderating
religion in Japan. At the same time I quite
admit that it has had a marked effect on the religious life
of the people, and that it again has been influenced by the
ancient Shinto (literally, &ldquo;The way of the gods&rdquo;) belief
of the Japanese people. This belief, a compound of
mythology and ancestral worship, was about the first
century largely encrusted by Confucian doctrines or
maxims, mostly ethical, imported from China. Of the
precise doctrines of Shintoism but little is even now
known. It has apparently no dogmas and no sacred book.
I am aware that there are the ancient Shinto rituals, called
Nurito, and that in reference to them a vast amount of
more or less erudite commentary has been written. The
result, however, has not been very enlightening. I think
that Kaemfer succinctly summed up the Shinto faith in
reference to the Japanese people when he remarked, &ldquo;The
more immediate end which they propose to themselves is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a state of happiness in this world.&rdquo; In other words, if this
assertion be correct, Shintoism preaches utilitarianism. As
to the origin of this religion there is very much the same
uncertainty and quite as large an amount of theorising as is
the case in reference to the Japanese race and language.
The most generally received opinion is that Shintoism is
closely allied with, if not an offshoot of, the old religion of
the Chinese people prior to the days of Confucius. Originally
Shinto was in all probability a natural religion, but,
like all religious systems, it has developed or suffered from
accretions until the ancient belief is lost in obscurity.
The author of a now somewhat out-of-date book, entitled
&ldquo;Progress of Japan,&rdquo; asserts that the religion of the
Japanese consists in a &ldquo;belief that the productive ethereal
spirit being expanded through the whole universe, every part
is in some degree impregnated with it and therefore every
part is in some measure the seat of the Deity; whence
local gods and goddesses are everywhere worshipped
and consequently multiplied without end. Like the
ancient Romans and Greeks they acknowledge a supreme
being, the first, the supreme, the intellectual, by which men
have been reclaimed from rudeness and barbarism to
elegance and refinement, and been taught through
privileged men and women not only to live with more
comfort but to die with better hope.&rdquo; Such a religion,
however it may be described, seems to me to be in effect
Pantheism.</p>

<p>When Buddhism was introduced into Japan the Buddhist
priesthood seems to have made no difficulty about
receiving the native gods into their Pantheon. Gradually
the greater number of the Shinto temples were served by
Buddhist priests who introduced into them the elaborate
ornaments and ritual of Buddhism. The result was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
kind of hybrid religion, the line of demarcation between
the ancient and the imported faith not being very clearly
defined. Hence perhaps the religious tolerance of the
Japanese for so many centuries, even to Christianity when
first introduced by St. Francis Xavier. About the beginning
of the eighteenth century there was something
akin to a religious reformation in Japan in the direction
of the revival of pure Shintoism. For a century and a half
subsequently Shintoism held up its head, and eventually,
as the outcome of the Revolution of 1868, which marked a
turning-point in the history of Japan, Buddhism was disestablished
and disendowed and Shinto was installed as
the State religion. Simultaneously many thousand of
Buddhist temples were stripped of their magnificent and
elaborate ornaments and handed over to Shinto keeping;
but the downfall of Buddhism was merely of a temporary
nature. Nevertheless Shinto is, ostensibly at any
rate, still the State religion. Certain temples are maintained
from public funds and certain official religious
functions take place in Shinto edifices.</p>

<p>Buddhism, acclimatised though it has been in Japan for
thirteen centuries, is still a foreign religion, but it has
played, and to some extent still plays, an important part
in the life and history of the nation, and it has, as I have
said, materially influenced the ancient faith of Japan and
in turn been influenced by it. I have no intention of
describing, much less tracing, the history of Buddhism,
whether in Japan or elsewhere. It is a subject on which
many writers have descanted and in regard to which much
might still be written. There is no doubt whatever that
Buddhism as it exists to-day, whether in Ceylon, India,
China, or Japan, is widely different from the religion of
its founder. Many of its original doctrines were purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
symbolical and poetical. These have been evolved into
something they were certainly never intended to mean.
That the principles of the Buddhist religion are essentially
pure and moral no one who has any knowledge of it can
deny. It preaches above all things the suppression of self,
and it inculcates a tenderness and fondness for all forms of
life. According to Griffis, &ldquo;Its commandments are the
dictates of the most refined morality. Besides the cardinal
prohibitions against murder, stealing, adultery, lying,
drunkenness and unchastity, every shade of vice, hypocrisy,
anger, pride, suspicion, greediness, gossiping, cruelty
to animals is guarded against by special precepts. Among
the virtues recommended we find not only reverence of
parents, care of children, submission to authority, gratitude,
moderation in times of prosperity, submission in
times of trial, equanimity at all times, but virtues such as
the duty of forgiving insults and not rewarding evil with
evil.&rdquo; This is a pretty exhaustive moral code, and though
Buddhism has often been taunted with the fact that its
followers do not practically carry out its precepts and live
up to the level of its high moral teaching, Buddhism is
not, I would suggest, the only religion against which
such taunts can be levelled.</p>

<p>The history of Buddhism ever since its introduction into
Japan has been an eventful one. It has had its ups and
its downs. It came into the country under royal auspices,
it has nearly always enjoyed the royal favour, and I think
its existence, during at any rate the first few centuries it
was in the country, has been due to that fact rather than
to any pronounced affection on the part of the mass of the
people for it. One Emperor, Shirakawa by name, is
recorded to have erected more than 50,000 pagodas and
statues throughout the country in honour of Buddha.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Many of these works are still, after many centuries, in an
excellent state of preservation, and are of deep interest not
only to the antiquarian but to any student of the religious
history of a nation. The Buddhist priests, like the Jesuits
in European countries, during many centuries captured
and controlled education in Japan and showed themselves
thoroughly progressive in their methods and the knowledge
they inculcated. Art and medicine were introduced
under their auspices and, whatever one may think of, or
whatever criticism may be passed on the religion itself, it
is impossible, in my opinion, to deny that Buddhism on the
whole has had a vast and, I venture to think, not an
unhealthy influence on every phase of Japanese national
and domestic life. The strength and weakness of Buddhism
have undoubtedly lain in the fact that it possessed
and possesses no dogmatic creed. It concerned itself
almost entirely with self-mastery, self-suppression, the
duty of doing good in this world without looking forward
to any reward for the same in the next. It preached
benevolence in the true meaning of that word in every
shape and form. It taught that benevolence was the
highest aspiration of a noble spirit. Benevolence was,
indeed, the master virtue, the crown, the coping stone, of
all virtues. As the term is used in Buddhist teaching, it
may be regarded as the synonym of love and a close study
of the teaching of Buddhism on this subject must impress
any thinking man strongly with the idea that it was very
much the teaching of Christ in reference to the love of
one&rsquo;s neighbour. Buddhism in Japan at any rate has not
been conservative; it has gone the way of most religious
systems, has been subject to development and has evolved
from time to time different sects, some of which have held
and preached dogmas which would, I think, have astounded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and I feel certain would have been anathematised by, the
founder of Buddhism. The principal of the sects now
existing in Japan are the Tendai, Shingon Yoko and
Ken, all of which, I may observe, are of Chinese origin.
Besides these there are the Shin and the Nichiren evolved
in Japan and dating from the thirteenth century. Respecting
the metaphysics of Buddhism and their effect on
the Japanese people I cannot, I think, do better than quote
from that great authority on all things Japanese, Mr.
Basil Hall Chamberlain, whose writings have done so
much, not only to awaken an interest in Japan but to give
correct ideas respecting the life of the people. He remarks,
in this connection, &ldquo;The complicated metaphysics of
Buddhism have awakened no interest in the Japanese
nation. Another fact, curious but true, is that these people
have never been at the trouble to translate the Buddhist
canon into their own language. The priests use a Chinese
version, the laity no version at all nowadays, though to
judge from the allusions scattered up and down Japanese
literature they would seem to have been more given to
searching the Scriptures a few hundred years ago. The
Buddhist religion was disestablished and disendowed
during the years 1871-4&mdash;a step taken in consequence of
the temporary ascendency of Shinto. At the present time
a faint struggle is being carried on by the Buddhist priesthood
against rivals in comparison with whom Shinto is
insignificant: we mean the two great streams of European
thought&mdash;Christianity and physical science. A few&mdash;a
very few&mdash;men trained in European methods fight for the
Buddhist cause. They do so, not as orthodox believers
in any existing sect, but because they are convinced that
the philosophical contents of Buddhism in general are
supported by the doctrine of evolution, and that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
religion needs therefore only to be regenerated on modern
lines in order to find universal acceptance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; of 1868 in Japan followed much
the same course in regard to religious matters as the
Reformation in England. It laid vandal hands on Buddhist
temples and ornaments of priceless value. The
objective point of this religious Reformation was presumably
very much the same as that which occurred in
this country, viz., a reversion to simplicity in religion.
The Shinto Temple which is invariably thatched is a
development of the ancient Japanese hut, whereas the
Buddhist Temple, which is of Indian origin, is tiled, and as
regards its internal fittings and ornamentation is elaborate
in comparison with the plain appearance of the Shinto
edifice.</p>

<p>So far as the Japan of to-day is concerned these two
religions may be regarded as moribund, although their
temples are still thronged by the lower classes of the
people. They exist because they are there, but they have
no vitality, no message for the people, and it is questionable
whether any of Japan&rsquo;s great thinkers or the educated
classes in the country, whichever religion they may
nominally belong to, have faith or belief in it. A man
may have, or for sundry reasons profess, a creed in Japan
as in other countries without believing in it. Custom and
prejudices are as strong there as elsewhere, and it is often
easier to appear to acquiesce in a religion than to openly
reject it.</p>

<p>There are, I know, some optimistic persons who believe,
or affect to believe, that Christianity is in due course
destined to replace the ancient faiths in Japan. They
point to what was effected by St. Francis Xavier in the
sixteenth century, and they imagine that the Japan of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
twentieth century is only waiting to finally unshackle
itself from Shintoism and Buddhism before arraying itself
in the garb of Christianity. Well, Christian missions have
had a fair field in Japan for many years past, and though
many members of those missions have been men of great
piety, zeal, and learning, they have made comparatively
little headway among and have exercised extremely little
influence on the mass of the Japanese people. Indeed, the
fair field that all Christian missions without distinction
have had, in my opinion, accounts for the small amount of
progress they have made. Because all the leading Christian
denominations are there&mdash;Roman Catholicism, Church of
England, Greek Church, Congregationalists, Methodists,
Baptists, Salvation Army, Society of Friends, and others&mdash;all
preaching and proclaiming their own particular dogmas
and all lumped together by the Japanese under the generic
title of Christians. The Japanese may, I think, be excused
if he fails to differentiate between them. He views and
hears their differences in dogma. He observes that there
is no bond of union, and frequently considerable jealousy
among these numerous sects. Each claims to preach
the truth, and the Japanese concludes that as they
cannot all be right they may possibly all be wrong. It is
only on this assumption that it is possible to account for
the little headway made by Christianity in Japan in view
of the labour and money devoted by different religious
bodies to its propagation for many years past. There is,
let me add, no marked hostility to Christianity in Japan&mdash;only
indifference. The educated Japanese of to-day is, I
believe, for the most part an agnostic, and he views
Shintoism, Buddhism, Christianity alike, except in so far as
he regards the first two as more or less national and the
last as an exotic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
At the commencement of the seventeenth century the
Japanese Christians are stated to have amounted in
numbers to one million. At the present time it is doubtful
if they total up to one hundred thousand. And this despite
the splendid religious organisations that exist, the facilities
that are given for the propagation of the Christian faith,
and the opportunities which were certainly not in existence
three hundred years ago. Into the causes of this comparative
failure of Christianity in Japan to-day as compared
with its marvellous progress in the sixteenth century, I
do not propose to enter. The enthusiasm of a Francis
Xavier is not an everyday event, and the Japanese of the
sixteenth century was, mayhap, more impressed by the
missionaries of those days, arriving in flimsy and diminutive
vessels after undergoing the perils and hardships of long
voyages, having neither purse nor scrip nor wearing
apparel except what they stood up in, than he is by the
modern missionary arriving as a first-class passenger in a
magnificent steamer and during his residence in the country
lacking none of the comforts or amenities of life. Or it
may be that the Japanese mind has advanced and developed
during the past three centuries, has now less hankering after
metaphysical subtleties, and fails to comprehend or to
sympathise with abstruse theological dogmas and doctrines.
If Christianity appealed to him as in the days of Francis
Xavier as the one faith professed by the Western world,
it would probably impress him to a far greater extent than
it does at present when, as I have before said, he views
Christianity as a disorganised body composed of hundreds
of sects each rejecting, and many of them anathematising,
what the others teach. He considers there is no need for
investigation until Christianity has itself determined what
is the precise truth that non-Christian countries are to be
asked to accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Regarding the influence of the Buddhist and Shinto
religions during the many centuries they have existed in
the country on the lives of the people, I propose to make
a few remarks. Too often one hears or reads of speakers
and writers describing Japan as a country steeped in
paganism and addicted to pagan habits and customs with
all (somewhat indefinite this!) that they involve. To
describe Buddhism as paganism merely shows a lamentable
amount of ignorance; nor should I be inclined to include
Shintoism in a term which, whatever its precise meaning,
is invariably intended to be opprobrious! After all, any
religion must be largely judged by its effects on the lives
of its adherents, and judged by that standard I do not
think, as regards the Japanese, either Buddhism or
Shintoism ought to be sweepingly condemned. If many
of the customs and practices of both religions seem silly
or absurd; if either or both inculcate or lead to superstition,
it can at least be said of both that they teach a high moral
code, and that the average Japanese in his life, his family
relations, his philosophy, his patriotism, his bodily cleanliness,
and in many other respects, offers an example to other
nations which deem themselves more highly civilised, which
possess a purer religion and too often, with that lack of
charity which is frequently the result of an excess of
ignorance, unsparingly condemn the Japanese as &ldquo;pagans&rdquo;
or &ldquo;heathens.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE CONSTITUTION&mdash;THE CROWN AND THE HOUSES OF
PARLIAMENT</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> CONSTITUTION, if we are to accept the dogmatic
assertions of those who have written with a show of
learning on the subject, ought to be evolved rather than
established by any parliamentary or despotic act. The
history of the world certainly tends to prove that paper
Constitutions have not been over-successful in the past.
There assuredly has been no lack of them in the last
century or so, and although some, if not all, of them have
been practically tried, a very few have attained any
considerable measure of success. The English Constitution
has long been held up to the rest of the world by writers
on Constitutional history as a model of what a Constitution
ought to be, for the somewhat paradoxical reason that it is
nowhere clearly, if indeed at all, defined. It is largely the
outcome of custom and usage, and it is claimed for it that
on the whole it has worked better than any cut-and-dried
paper Constitution would have done.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there does not appear to be any good and
valid reason why a Constitution should not be as clearly
defined as an Act of Parliament. Undefined Constitutions
have worked well at certain periods when there was a tacit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
general consent as to their meaning, but they have not
always been able to withstand the strain of fierce controversy
and the coming into existence of factors which
were undreamt of when these Constitutions were originally
evolved, and definitions or additions or amendments
thereto have, accordingly, become necessary.</p>

<p>The promulgation of a Constitution for Japan in February,
1889, was an event of great interest to the civilised
world. There were, of course, at the time a large number
of persons who prophesied that this Constitution would
go the way of many others that had preceded it&mdash;that
it would, in fact, be found unworkable and, being so found,
Constitutional Government in Japan would eventuate, as
it had elsewhere, in the resumption of autocratic rule as
the only alternative to anarchy. It is pleasing to be
able to record that these prophecies have, after nearly
eighteen years&rsquo; experience, not been fulfilled, and that
the Japanese Constitution, well thought out and devised
as it was, seems not only likely to endure but is admirably
adapted to all the circumstances and needs of the
country.</p>

<p>In order to fully comprehend the events that gradually
led up to the establishment of Constitutional government
in Japan, and the precise place of the Crown and
aristocracy in that government, it is, I think, essential to
make a rapid review of past events in that country.</p>

<p>In ancient times the Mikado was both the civil ruler
and the military leader of his people. Under him there
were exercising authority throughout the land about 150
feudal lords. Feudalism of one kind or another prevailed
in Japan until 1868. Towards the end of the sixteenth
century the feudal principle was apparently on the decline.
In the year 1600, however, Tokagawa Iyoyasu, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
army composed of the clans of the east and north
defeated the combined forces of those of the west and
south at the battle of Sakigahara and proclaimed himself
Shogun. The feudal lords of the various clans throughout
the country then became his vassals and paid homage to
him. The Tokagawa family practically governed the
country till the Revolution of 1868, when the present
Emperor took the reins of government into his own hands
and finally abolished feudalism and with it the authority
of the Daimios. Many persons even now believe that
the Shogun, or Tycoon as he was usually called in Europe,
was a usurper. As a matter of fact he received investiture
from the Mikado, and his authority was, nominally at any
rate, a derived one. At the same time there is no doubt
that the real power of the State was in his hands while
the <i>de jure</i> ruler lived in the capital in complete seclusion
surrounded by all the appanages and ceremonial of royalty.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1868 Japan was divided into numerous
provinces governed by Daimios, or territorial lords, each
of whom maintained large standing armies. They were
all subject to the Shogun, while retaining the right to
rule their particular provinces in ordinary matters. In
1868 the Shogun fell, and there can be little doubt his
fall was to some extent brought about by the concessions
which had been made to foreign Powers in regard to
the opening of the country to foreign trade. In 1868
the Shogun repaired to Kyoto, the first time for 250
years, and paid homage to the Mikado. Feudalism was
then, as I have said, abolished, the Emperor took the
reins of authority into his own hands, formed a central
Government at Tokio and reigned supreme as an absolute
monarch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sacred throne was established at the time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the heavens and earth became separated.&rdquo; This has
long been an axiom of Japanese belief, but it has been
somewhat modified of late years, even the assertion of it
by the Sovereign himself. A leading Japanese statesman
who has written an article on the subject of the Emperor
and his place in the Constitution has asserted that he
is &ldquo;Heaven descended, sacred and divine.&rdquo; I do not
think that the modern Japanese entertains this transcendental
opinion nor, indeed, do I find that the Emperor
himself has of late years put forward any such pretensions.
For example, in the Imperial proclamation on the Constitution
of the Empire on February 11, 1889, the
Emperor declared that he had &ldquo;by virtue of the glories
of our ancestors ascended the Throne of a lineal succession
unbroken for <em>ages eternal</em>.&rdquo; Whereas in the Imperial
Rescript declaring war against China on August 1, 1894,
he contented himself with asserting that he was &ldquo;seated
on a Throne occupied by the same dynasty from <em>time
immemorial</em>.&rdquo; The italics are mine, and the difference
in the pretensions which I desire to emphasise is certainly
remarkable.</p>

<p>When granting a Constitution the Emperor, as has been
and probably will be the custom of all monarchs so acting,
declared that the legislative power belonged to him but
that he intended to exercise it with the consent of the
Imperial Diet. The convocation of the Diet belongs
exclusively to the Emperor. It has no power to meet
without his authority, and if it did so meet its acts and
its actions would be null and void. In this respect the
Diet is on precisely the same basis as the English Parliament.
According to the Constitution the Emperor,
when the Diet is not sitting, can issue Imperial ordinances
which shall have the effect of law so long as they do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
not contravene any existing law. The article authorising
these ordinances defines that they shall only be promulgated
in consequence of an urgent necessity to maintain
public safety or to avert public calamities, and all such
ordinances must be laid before the Diet at its next sitting,
and in the event of the same not being approved they
become null and void.</p>

<p>To my mind, one of the most interesting portions of
the Constitution is that which lays down succinctly and
tersely the rights and duties of Japanese subjects. In
this section there are contained within about fifty lines
the declaration of innumerable rights for which mankind
in various parts of the world during many hundreds of
years fought and bled and endured much suffering. Just
let me mention a few of them. No Japanese subject shall
be arrested, detained, tried or punished unless according
to law. Except as provided by law the house of no
Japanese subject shall be entered or searched without
his consent. Except in the cases provided by law, the
secrecy of the letters of every Japanese subject shall
remain inviolate. The right of property of every Japanese
subject shall remain inviolate. Japanese subjects shall
enjoy freedom of religious belief. Japanese subjects
shall enjoy liberty of speech, writing, publication, public
meetings and associations. Japanese subjects may present
petitions. We have in these few brief provisoes the
sum total of everything that, in effect, constitutes the
liberty of the subject.</p>

<p>The Diet of Japan, like the Parliament of Great Britain,
consists of two Houses&mdash;a House of Peers and a House
of Representatives. The House of Peers is composed
of (1) the members of the Imperial family, (2) Princes
and Marquises, (3) Counts, Viscounts and Barons who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
are elected thereto by the members of their respective
orders, (4) persons who have been specially nominated
by the Emperor on account of meritorious service or by
reason of their erudition, (5) persons who have been
elected, one member for each city and prefecture of the
Empire, by and from among the taxpayers of the highest
amount of direct national taxes on land, industry, or
trade, and who had subsequently received the approval
of the Emperor. It will be seen that the members of
the Imperial family, the Princes and Marquises, have an
inalienable right to sit in the House of Peers, the latter
rank on attaining the age of 25 years. In regard to
Counts, Viscounts, and Barons there is no such right.
Those ranks, like the Peers of Scotland and Ireland,
meet together and select one-fifth of their number to
represent them in the House of Peers for a term of seven
years. Any subject over thirty years of age nominated
by the Emperor for meritorious service or erudition
remains a life member. Those returned by the cities
and prefectures remain members for a period of seven
years. It is provided by the Constitution that the
number of members of the House of Peers who are not
nobles shall not exceed the number of the members
bearing a title of nobility.</p>

<p>The question of the necessity for the existence of a
second chamber and the composition thereof has been
keenly debated in this and other countries of recent years.
It seems to me that in this matter Japan has hit upon
the happy mean. She has combined in her House of
Peers the aristocratic or hereditary element in a modified
degree with the principle of life membership by which
she secures the services and counsel of the great intellects
of the land, and such as have done the State good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
service in any capacity. At the same time she has not
excluded the representative element from her second
chamber&mdash;a fact which must largely obviate any possibility
of the House of Peers becoming a purely class body.
A second chamber so constituted must obviously serve
an extremely useful purpose in preserving an equilibrium
between political parties, in preventing the rushing
through and passing into law of hastily considered
measures. For the composition of her second chamber,
Japan has taken all human means possible to obtain
whatever is representative of the stability, the intellect,
the enterprise and the patriotism of the country.</p>

<p>The composition of the House of Representatives, which
answers to our House of Commons, is as interesting as
that of the Upper Chamber. When the Constitution was
first promulgated the principle of small electoral districts
obtained, one member being elected for each district.
This system was found or believed to be faulty, and
hence, after some years&rsquo; experience, large electoral districts
combined with a single vote have been instituted. It may
be interesting to relate that both systems, the large and
the small districts, were drafted by an Englishman, Mr.
Thomas Hair. Cities whose population exceeds 30,000
are formed into separate electoral districts while a city
with less than 30,000 inhabitants is, with its suburbs,
constituted a district. The number of members allowed
to each district depends on the population. For a
population of 130,000 or under one member is allowed,
and for every additional 65,000 persons above the
former number an additional member is allotted. The
number of members in the House of Representatives is
381, or little over half that of which our House of
Commons consists. The population of the two countries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is almost identical, and experience serves to show that the
number of Members of Parliament in Japan is sufficiently
numerous for all practical purposes and that any material
addition thereto would be more likely to impede than to
accelerate the wheels of legislative progress. Neither the
Japanese Constitution nor the Electoral Law makes any
provision for the representation of minorities, that aim of
so many well-meaning persons in different countries. In
Japan the majority rules as everywhere, and minorities
must submit.</p>

<p>Manhood suffrage is not yet a <i>fait accompli</i> in Japan.
Under the present law to qualify a Japanese subject to
exercise the franchise he must pay 15 yen (about 30s.)
or more, indirect taxation. Only a Japanese subject can
vote at elections. No foreigner has any electoral rights,
but if he becomes a naturalised Japanese subject he
obtains all the privileges appertaining to that position.</p>

<p>Each House of Parliament in Japan possesses a
president and vice-president, who are elected by the
members. The president of each House receives an
annual allowance of 4,000 yen (about &pound;400) and the
vice-president 2,000 yen (about &pound;200). The payment of
Members of Parliament is in vogue in Japan. The elected
and nominated, but not the hereditary, members of the
House of Peers, and each member of the House of
Representatives, receives an annual allowance of 800 yen
(about &pound;80). They are also paid travelling expenses in
accordance with the regulations on the subject. It may
be interesting to state that there is a clause in the
Constitution which enacts that the president, vice-president,
and members of the two Houses who are entitled to
annual allowances shall not be permitted to decline the
same! It says much for the estimate of patriotism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
entertained in Japan when the Constitution was promulgated
that such a clause as this should have been
considered necessary.</p>

<p>Debate in both the Japanese Houses of Parliament is
free and the proceedings public. There will be no
occasion for the uprising of a Wilkes in Japan to obtain
permission to publish Parliamentary Debates. The
Constitution, however, contains a proviso for the sitting
of either House with closed doors upon the wish of the
president or of not less than ten members, the same
being agreed to by the House, or upon the demand of
the Government with or without the consent of the House.
When in the former event a motion for a secret sitting is
made, strangers have to withdraw from the House and
the motion is voted on without debate. The proceedings
of a secret meeting of either Chamber are not allowed to be
published.</p>

<p>The Japanese Constitution, which is certainly a
document containing not only provisions of an epoch-making
nature but most elaborate details in regard to
even minor matters, includes in seven or eight lines one
or two excellent rules in regard to what is termed &ldquo;The
Passing of the Budget.&rdquo; Under these rules, when the
Budget is introduced into the House of Representatives
the Committee thereon must finish the examination of it
within fifteen days and report thereon to the House,
while no motion for any amendment in the Budget
can be made the subject of debate unless it is supported
by at least thirty members.</p>

<p>The Constitution of Japan, as I have remarked, contains
a vast amount of detail. The framers of that Constitution
seem to have been endowed with an abnormal amount of
prevision. In fact they foresaw the possibility of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
occurrences and made provision for those occurrences that
nations which are, or which consider themselves to be, more
highly civilised have not yet taken any adequate steps to
deal with. For example, Article 92 of the Constitution
enacts that in neither House of Parliament shall the use of
coarse language or personalities be allowed, while Article
93 declares that when any member has been vilified or
insulted either in the House or in a meeting of a Committee
he shall appeal to the House and demand that
proper measures shall be taken. There shall, it is decreed,
be no retaliation among members. The Constitution also
contains several salutary regulations in reference to the
disciplinary punishment of members.</p>

<p>The establishment of a Parliament in Japan has produced
parties and a party system. I suppose that was inevitable.
In every country there is, and as human nature is constituted
there always will be, two parties representative of
two phases of the human mind: the party in a hurry to
effect progress because it deems progress desirable, and
the party that desires to cling as long as possible to the
ancient ways because it knows them and has had
experience of them and looks askance at experiments&mdash;experiments
for which that somewhat hackneyed phrase
a &ldquo;leap in the dark&rdquo; has long done service. I have no
intention, as I said in the Preface, of dealing at all with
Japanese politics. There is no doubt a good deal of heat,
and the resultant friction, evoked in connection with
politics in Japan as elsewhere. Perhaps this young nation&mdash;that
is, young from a parliamentary point of view&mdash;takes
politics too seriously. Time will remedy that defect, if it
be a defect. At the same time, I may express the opinion
that, however severe party strife may be in Japan, and
though the knocks given and received in the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
thereof are hard and some of the language not only
vigorous but violent, the members of all parties have at
heart and as their objective point the advancement of
Japan and the good of the country generally.</p>

<p>The Japanese Constitution, though not a very lengthy,
is such an all-embracing document that in a hurried survey
of it, it is possible to overlook many important features.
It provides for the establishment of a Privy Council to
deliberate upon important matters of State, but only when
consulted by the Emperor. It enforces the responsibility
of the Ministers of State for all advice given to the
Emperor and decrees that all laws, Imperial ordinances
and Imperial rescripts of any kind relating to affairs of
State, must be countersigned by a Minister of State. The
Constitution also defines the position, authority, and
independence of the judges. That Constitution contains
a proviso all-important in reference to the upright
administration of the law, a proviso which it took
years of agitation to obtain in this country, that no
judge shall be deprived of his position unless by way
of criminal sentence or disciplinary punishment. All
trials and judgments of the court of law are to be conducted
publicly. Provision is made, when there exists any
fear of a trial in open court being prejudicial to peace and
order or to the maintenance of public morality, for the
same to be held in camera. I may add, before I take leave
of the Constitution, with a view of showing how all-embracing
as I have said are the various matters dealt
with therein, that it defines and declares that the style
of address for the Emperor and Empress shall be His, Her,
or Your Majesty, while that for the Imperial Princes and
Princesses shall be His, Her, Their, or Your Highness or
Highnesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
In regard to no matter connected with Japan have I
found so large an amount of misconception prevalent as in
reference to the position of the Emperor of that country.
The divine descent which is still sometimes claimed for the
sovereigns of Japan and which has never, so far as I know,
been officially repudiated, has caused some persons to
regard the Emperor from a somewhat ludicrous standpoint.
In this very prosaic and materialistic age, when very few
persons have profound beliefs on any subject, the spectacle
of one of the sovereigns of the earth still claiming a divine
origin is one that appeals to the ludicrous susceptibilities
of that vague entity &ldquo;the man in the street.&rdquo; It is not
well, however, that people should criticise statements in
royal proclamations or in royal assertions too seriously.
Even in this country there are documents issued from time
to time bearing the royal sign manual which every one
regards as interesting but meaningless formalities&mdash;interesting
because they are a survival of medi&aelig;val documents
which meant something some hundreds of years ago and
still remain though their meanings have long since lapsed.
And yet there are persons in this country who peruse such
documents and know that they are simply words signifying
practically nothing, who severely criticise the assertion of
a long-used title by the Japanese Emperor upon issuing a
royal proclamation. I am not aware whether his Imperial
Majesty or his Ministers of State implicitly accept his divine
descent, but this I do know&mdash;that those persons who regard
the present Emperor of Japan as a State puppet, arrogating
more or less divine attributes, are labouring under a profound
delusion. There is no abler man in Japan at the present
moment. There is no abler man among the sovereigns of
the world. In fact, I should be inclined to place the
Emperor of Japan at the head of the world&rsquo;s great statesmen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
He is no monarch content to reign but not to govern,
concerned simply about ceremonial and the fripperies and
gew-gaws of royalty. He is a constitutional sovereign
certainly. He has always shown the deepest respect for
the Constitution ever since its promulgation, and never in
the slightest degree attempted to infringe or override any
portion of it. At the same time he is an effective force in
the Government of Japan. There is nothing too great or
too little in the Empire or in the relations of the Empire
with foreign Powers for his ken. He, in a word, has the
whole reins of government in his hands, and he exercises
over every department and detail of it a minute and rigid
supervision which is, in my opinion, largely responsible for
the efficiency of the internal administration of the country
as also for the place that Japan holds among the Great
Powers of the world.</p>

<p>I cannot leave a consideration of this subject without
referring to the assistance rendered to the Emperor by, as
also to the debt Japan owes to, some six or seven great
men in that country whose names I shall not inscribe here
because to do so would be to some extent invidious,
several of whom do not, as a matter of fact, hold any formal
position in the Government of the country. The wisdom
of these men has been a great boon for such a country as
Japan, and if she is not now as sensible of it as she ought to
be future ages will, I feel sure, recognise the debt that Japan
owes to them. Some persons with an intimate knowledge
of Japan have told me that it is not, after all, a constitutional
State but in effect, though not in name, an oligarchy. This
word has in the past often had unpleasant associations,
and one does not like to apply it in reference to the Government
of a progressive and enlightened country. Still the
word strictly means government by a small body of men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and if in those men is included the larger part of the
wisdom of the country, and they exercise their power
solely and exclusively for the benefit of the country, I am
not certain that such a form of government is not the best
that could be devised. Of course, humanity being as it is,
an oligarchy, has its dangers and its temptations. I will
say, however, of the wise men of Japan, the men to whom
I have been referring and who whether in office or out of
office have exercised, and must continue to exercise, a
marked and predominant influence on the government of
the country, that their patriotism has never been called in
question, and no one has at any time suggested that they
were influenced by self-seeking or other unworthy motives,
or had any aspirations save the material and moral
advancement of Japan and her elevation to a prominent
position among the Great Powers of the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE PEOPLE&mdash;THEIR LIFE AND HABITS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER all, the life of the people is the most interesting,
as I think it is the most instructive, matter connected
with any country. It is assuredly impossible to
form a clear or indeed any correct idea in regard to a
nation unless we know something of the manners and
customs, the daily life, the amusements, the vices of its
people. Unless we can, as it were, take a bird&rsquo;s-eye view
of the people at work and at play, at their daily avocations
in their homes, see them as they come into the world, as
they go through life&rsquo;s pilgrimage, and, finally, as they pay
the debt of nature and are carried to their last resting-place
in accordance with the national customs, with the respect
or the indifference the nation shows for its dead.</p>

<p>If one is to arrive at a correct idea regarding the life and
habits of the Japanese people it is, I think, essential to get
away from the ports and large towns where they have been
influenced by or brought much into contact with Europeans,
and see them as they really are, free from conventionalities,
artificialities, and the effects of Western habits and customs
which have undoubtedly been pronounced in those centres
where Europeans congregate.</p>

<p>The house in Japan does not play the important part it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
does in this country. When a man in England, whatever
his station in life may be, contemplates taking a wife and
settling down, as the phrase goes, the home and the
contents thereof become an all-important matter and one
needing much thought and discussion. In Japan there is
no such necessity. A Japanese house is easily run up&mdash;and
taken down. The &ldquo;walls&rdquo; are constructed of paper
and slide in grooves between the beams of the floor which
is raised slightly above the ground. The partitions
between the rooms can easily be taken down and an
additional room as easily run up. The house is, as a rule,
only one storey high. The carpets consist of matting only,
and practically no furniture is necessary. A witty writer
on Japan has aptly and wittily remarked that &ldquo;an Englishman&rsquo;s
house may be his castle, a Japanese&rsquo;s house is his
bedroom and his bedroom is a passage.&rdquo; The occupant of
this house sits on the floor, sleeps on the floor, and has his
meals on the floor. The floor is kept clean by the simple
process of the inhabitants removing their boots, or what
do duty for boots, and leaving them at the entrance, so as
to avoid soiling the matting with which the floor of each
room is covered. This is a habit which has much to
commend it, and is, I suggest, worthy of imitation by other
countries. After all, the Japanese mode of life has a great
deal to be said in its favour. It seems strange at first, but
after the visitor to the country has got over his initial fit of
surprise at the difference between the Japanese domestic
economy and his own, he will, if he be a man of unprejudiced
mind, admit that it certainly has its &ldquo;points.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bulk of the population is poor, very poor, but that
poverty is not emphasised in their homes to the same
extent as in European countries. The house&mdash;a doll&rsquo;s
house some irreverent people term it&mdash;with paper partitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
doing duty for walls, white matting, a few cooking utensils
costs only a few shillings. It can, as I have said, be taken
down and run up easily, and enlarged almost indefinitely.
The inhabitants sleep on the floor, and the bedding consists
not as with us of mattresses, palliasses, and other more or
less insanitary articles, but of a number, great or small,
and elaborate or otherwise, in accordance with the means
of the owner, of what I will term quilts. The Japanese
pillow is a fearful and wonderful article. I can never
imagine how it was evolved and why it has remained so
long unimproved. It is made of wood and there is a
receptacle for the head. The European who uses it finds
that it effectually banishes sleep, while the ordinary
Japanese is apparently unable to sleep without it. In
most houses, however poor, a kakemono, or wall picture, is
to be seen. It is usually the only decoration save an
occasional vase containing flowers, and of course flowers
themselves, which are in evidence everywhere. Light is,
or used to be, given by a &ldquo;lamp,&rdquo; a kind of Chinese lantern
on a lacquer stand, the light being given by a rush candle.
I am sorry, however, to say that these in some respects
artistic lanterns are being generally replaced by hideous
petroleum or kerosene lamps, not only ugly but a constant
source of danger in these flimsy houses.</p>

<p>The most important accessory of nearly all Japanese
houses is the bath-room, or wash-house, to use a more
appropriate term. The hot bath is a universal institution
in the country, and nearly every Japanese man and woman,
whatever his or her station in life, washes the body
thoroughly in extremely hot water more than once daily.
The Japanese, as regards the washing of their persons, are
the cleanest race in the world, but many hygienic laws are
set at defiance possibly because they are not understood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
A gradual improvement is, however, taking place in these
matters, and the cleanliness as regards the body and their
houses, which is such a pleasing feature of the people, will
no doubt extend in other directions also.</p>

<p>Japanese houses are habitable enough in warm weather,
but in winter-time they are, as might be expected, exceedingly
cold, especially as the arrangements for warming
them are of an extremely primitive nature. Those complaints
which are induced or produced by cold are
prevalent in the country.</p>

<p>The food of the people is as simple as their houses, and
as inexpensive. A Japanese family it has been calculated
can live on about &pound;10 a year. A little fish, rice, and
vegetables, with incessant tea, is the national dietary.
The people living on this meagre fare are, on the whole,
a strong and sturdy race, but it is questionable if the
national physique would not be vastly improved were the
national diet also. I have touched on this matter elsewhere,
so I need not refer to it further here. Tobacco is
the constant consoler of the Japanese in all his troubles.
Why he smokes such diminutive pipes I have never been
able to understand. They only hold sufficient tobacco for
a few whiffs, and when staying in a Japanese house the
constant tap, tap, tap of the owner&rsquo;s pipe as he empties
the ashes out prior to refilling it reminds one of the woodpecker.</p>

<p>There are doubtless some persons, especially those
persons who consider that to enjoy life a superabundance
or even a plethora of material comforts are necessary, who,
after reading a description of the home and fare of the
Japanese peasant, will assume that his life is a burden and
that he derives no enjoyment whatever from it. Nothing
could be more erroneous. There is probably not a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
joyous being on the face of the globe than the Japanese.
His wants are few, and in that fact probably lies his
happiness. He does not find his enjoyment in material
things, but he has his enjoyment all the same, and I think
on the whole that he probably gets more out of life and has
more fitting ideas regarding it than the Englishman who
considers an abundance of beef and beer its objective point.</p>

<p>To me one of the most pleasing features of Japan is the
fondness and tenderness of the Japanese of all ranks and
classes for children. The Japanese infant is the tyrant of
Japan, and nothing is good enough for it. The women, as
most people know, carry their babies on their backs instead
of in their arms. A baby is, however, not so for very
long in Japan. Very young Japanese girls may be seen
carrying their little baby brothers and sisters behind their
backs, and thus learning their maternal duties in advance.
The position of women in Japan, married women, is not so
satisfactory as it ought to be. The laws in regard to
divorce are, I think, too easy, and a Japanese possesses
facilities for getting rid of his wife which does not tend to
the conservation of home-life. The custom, which was at
one time universal, of women blackening their teeth, has
largely diminished, and will no doubt in due course become
obsolete. The idea which underlay it was that the woman
should render herself unattractive to other men. There
was no object in having such an adventitious attraction as
pearly teeth for her husband, who might be presumed to
know what her attractions really were. The Japanese
woman in her education has inculcated three obediences,
viz., obedience to parents, obedience to husband, and after
the death of the latter obedience to son. Although the
Japanese girl comes of age at 14 she cannot marry without
her father&rsquo;s consent until she is 25.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The dress of the Japanese people is so well known that
it is not necessary for me to describe it. The kimono is,
I think, a graceful costume, and I am very sorry that so
many women in the upper classes have discarded the
national dress for European garments. Japanese women
who wear the national costume do not don gloves. If
their hands are cold they place them in their sleeves,
which are long and have receptacles containing many and
various things, including a pocket-handkerchief, which is
usually made of paper, and sometimes a pot of lip-salve to
colour the lips to the orthodox tint. The poorer classes,
of course, do not go in for such frivolities. Talking of
paper handkerchiefs reminds me of the innumerable uses
to which paper is put in Japan; it serves for umbrellas
and even for coats, and is altogether a necessity of existence
almost for the great mass of the people.</p>

<p>I have referred to the lack of what may be deemed
material comforts in Japan, as also to the fact that the
Japanese are a joyous race but that their enjoyment is not
of a material nature. They are, in fact, easily amused,
and their enjoyment takes forms which would hardly
appeal to a less emotional people. In the large towns
the theatre is a perennial source of amusement. I have
referred to the theatre in the chapter dealing with the
drama, and remarked therein that the excess of by-play,
irrelevant by-play, in a Japanese drama was rather
wearisome to the European spectator. Not so to the
Japanese. He positively revels in it. The theatre is for
him something real and moving. He has, whatever his
age, all the zest of a youth for plays and spectacles. How
far the Europeanising of the country, which is having, and
is bound still further to have, an effect on dramatic art,
will affect the amusements of the people and their proneness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for the theatre remains to be seen. There is so far
nothing approaching the English music-hall in Japan.
Let me express a hope that there never will be. It is a
long cry from the graceful Geisha to the inanities and
banalities which appear to be the stock-in-trade of music-hall
performances in this country. These appear to meet
a home want, but I sincerely trust they will be reserved
for home delectation and not be inflicted in any guise
upon Japan. The matter of music-halls suggests some
reference to the ideas of the Japanese in respect of music.
The educated classes appear to have an appreciation of
European music, but Japanese music requires, I should
say, an educational process. Some superficial European
writers declare that the Japanese have not the least conception
of either harmony or melody, and that what
passes for music in the country is simply discord. It
might have struck these writers that criticism of this kind
in reference to a most artistic people could hardly be
correct. Any one who has listened to the Geisha or
heard the singing of trained Japanese would certainly not
agree in such statements as I have referred to. Japanese
music is like Japanese art&mdash;it has its own characteristics
and will, I am sure, repay being carefully studied.</p>

<p>Festivals and feasts, religious and otherwise, which are
many and varied, afford some relaxation for the people.
There are, according to a list compiled, some 28 religious
festivals, 16 national holidays, and 14 popular feast-days.
New Year&rsquo;s Day is termed Shihohai, and on it the
Emperor prays to all his ancestors for a peaceful reign.
Two days subsequently, on Genjisai, he makes offerings to
him and all his Imperial ancestors, while two days later
still all Government officers make official calls. These are
legal holidays. The 11th of February (Kigen Setsu) and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the 3rd of April (Jimmu-Tenno-sai) are observed as the
anniversaries respectively of the accession to the throne and
the death of Jimmu-Tenno, the first Emperor. The 17th
of October (Shinsho-sai) is the national harvest festival.
On this day the Emperor offers the first crop of the year
to his divine ancestor, Tenshoko Daijin. It may be interesting
to record that the 25th of December (Christmas Day),
is observed as a holiday by the Custom-house department
&ldquo;for the accommodation of foreign employees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The popular festivals are equally interesting and curious.
The 3rd of March (Oshinasama), is the girls&rsquo; or dolls&rsquo; festival,
while the 5th of May (Osekku), is the boys&rsquo; festival, or Feast
of Flags. A three days&rsquo; festival, 13th-15th of July (Bon
Matsuri), is the All Souls&rsquo; Day of Japan in honour of the
sacred dead. The 9th of September (Kikku No Sekku), is
the festival of chrysanthemums, the national flower, and
the 20th of November, appropriately near the Lord Mayor
of London&rsquo;s day, is the festival held by the merchants in
honour of Ebisuko, the God of Wealth. The Feast of
Flags&mdash;the boys&rsquo; festival&mdash;is one much esteemed by the
Japanese people. On the occasion of it every house the
owner of which has been blessed with sons displays a
paper carp floating from a flagstaff. If a male child has
come to the establishment during the year the carp is
extra large. It is considered a reproach to any married
woman not to have this symbol flying outside the house
on the occasion of this feast. Why the carp has been
selected as a symbol is a matter upon which there is much
difference of opinion. The carp, it is said, is emblematic
of the youth who overcomes all the difficulties that lie in
his path during life, but I confess I rather fail to see what
connection there is between this fish and such an energetic
youth. On this day the boys have dolls representative of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Japanese heroes and personages of the past as well as toy
swords and toy armour. On the girls&rsquo; festival&mdash;the Feast
of Dolls&mdash;there is no outward and visible display. The
fact of a girl having been born in the family is not considered
a matter to be boasted of. On this feast there is
a great display indoors of dolls. As a matter of fact dolls
form a very important part of the heirlooms of every
Japanese family of any importance. When a girl is born
a pair of dolls are procured for her. Dolls are much
more seriously treated than they are in European countries,
where they are bought with the full knowledge that they
will quickly be destroyed. In Japan the dolls are packed
away for nearly the whole of the year in the go-down, and
are only produced at this particular festival. I may add
that not only the dolls themselves but furniture for them
are largely in request in Japan, and that this dolls&rsquo; festival
is really a very important function in the national life.</p>

<p>New Year&rsquo;s festival is the great day of the year in Japan.
In this respect it approximates to our Christmas. Not
only the houses but the streets are decorated, and every
town in the land has at this particular season an unusually
festive appearance. At this period visits are exchanged,
and New Year&rsquo;s presents are the correct thing.</p>

<p>On the Bon Matsuri, or All Souls&rsquo; Day, the Japanese
have a custom somewhat similar to that which obtains in
Roman Catholic countries on the 2nd of November. On
the first night of the feast the tombs of the dead during
the past year are adorned with Japanese lanterns. On the
second night the remaining tombs are likewise decorated,
while on the third night it is the custom, although it is
now somewhat falling into desuetude, for the relatives of
the dead to launch toy vessels made of straw laden with
fruit and coins as well as a lantern. These toy ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have toy sails, and the dead are supposed to sail in them
to oblivion until next year&rsquo;s festival. These toy ships, of
course, catch fire from the lanterns. Not so very many
years ago the spectacle of these little vessels catching fire
on some large bay was a very pretty one. I am afraid
this feast has a tendency to die out&mdash;a fact which is greatly
to be regretted, as there is behind it much that is poetical
and beautiful.</p>

<p>Wrestling, as most people know, is a favourite amusement
of the Japanese, and wrestling matches excite quite as
much interest as boxing used to do in this country. Of
late years English people have taken much interest in
Ju Jitsu. The Japanese style of wrestling is certainly
peculiar, and training does not apparently enter so much
into it as is considered essential in reference to displays of
strength or skill in this country. One sometimes sees
very expert Japanese wrestlers who are not only fat but
bloated.</p>

<p>The Japanese have long been celebrated archers, and
archery, though it is largely on the wane, is much more in
evidence than is the case in this country. It is an art
in which a great many of the people excel, and archery
grounds still exist in many of the towns.</p>

<p>Marriages and christenings have important parts in the
social life of the people. These ceremonies, however, are
not quite so obtrusive as they are in Western lands. As
regards christenings, if I may use such a term in reference
to a non-Christian people, the first, or almost the first,
ceremony in reference to the infant in Japan is, or used
to be, the shaving of its head thirty days after birth, after
which it was taken to the temple to make its first offering,
a pecuniary one, to the gods. This shaving of babies is
no doubt diminishing, at any rate in the large towns.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Indeed, everything in regard to the dressing of and dealing
with the hair in Japan is, if I may use the term, in a state
of transition.</p>

<p class="caption">STREET SCENE ON NEW YEAR&rsquo;S DAY<br />

<small>FROM A PRINT BY HIROSHIGE</small></p>

<p>Some writers on Japan have been impressed by the fact
that the Japanese appear to be more concerned about the
dead than the living. Ancestor worship plays an important
part in the religious economy of Japanese life, and, as I
have shown, the All Souls&rsquo; Day in Japan is an important
national festival. But the respect that these people have
for their dead is not shown only on one or two or three
days of the year; it may be deduced from a visit to any
of their cemeteries. These are nearly always picturesquely
situated, adorned with beautiful trees, and exquisitely kept
in order. Indeed, the cemeteries are in striking contrast
to those of European countries. The hideous and inartistic
tombstones and monuments, the urns and angels, and the
stereotyped conventionalities of graveyards in this country
are all absent. There is usually only a simple tablet over
each grave bearing the name of the deceased and the date
of his death, and occasionally some simple word or two
summing up succinctly those qualities he had, or was supposed
to have, possessed. Near each grave is usually a
flower-vase, and it is nearly always filled with fresh flowers.
As I have remarked, flowers play an important part in
the lives of the Japanese people, and with them no part is
more important than the decoration of the graves of their
dead. In England flowers also play an important part in
connection with the dead&mdash;on the day of the funeral. It
is then considered the correct thing for every one who
knew the deceased to send a wreath to be placed upon his
coffin. These wreaths, frequently exceedingly numerous,
are conveyed to the cemetery, where they are allowed to
rot on top of the grave. To me there is no more mournful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sight than a visit to a great London cemetery, where one
sees these rotting emblems, which quite palpably meant
nothing save the practice of a conventionality. The
Japanese, however poor his worldly circumstances may be,
is not content with flowers, costly flowers on the day of
the funeral; he places his vase alongside the grave of the
departed, and by keeping that vase filled with fresh and
beautiful flowers he sets forth as far as he possibly can his
feeling of respect for the dead and the fact that the dead
one still lives in his memory.</p>

<p>One cannot study, however cursorily, the lives of the
Japanese people on the whole without being convinced
of the fact that there is among them not only a total
absence of but no desire whatever for luxury. The whole
conception of life among these people seems to me to be
a healthy and a simple one. It is not in any way, or at
any rate to any great extent, a material conception. The
ordinary Japanese&mdash;the peasant, for example&mdash;does not
hanker after a time when he will have more to eat and
more to drink. He finds himself placed in a certain
position in life, and he attempts to get the best out of
life that he can. I do not suggest, of course, that the
Japanese peasant has ever philosophically discussed this
matter with himself or perhaps thought deeply, if at all,
about it. I am merely recording what his view of life is
judging by his actions. He, I feel confident, enjoys life.
In some respects his life no doubt is a hard one, but it has
its alleviations, and if I judge him aright the ordinary
Japanese does not let his mind dwell overmuch on his
hardships, but is content to get what pleasure he can out
of his surrounding conditions.</p>

<p>One very pleasing characteristic of the Japanese men
and women to which I have already referred is the habit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of personal cleanliness. In every town in the country
public baths are numerous, and every house of any pretensions
has a bath-room. The Japanese use extremely
hot water to wash in. The women do not enter the bath
immediately upon undressing, but in the first instance,
throwing some pailsful of water over the body, they sit on
the floor and scrub themselves with bran prior to entering
the bath, performing this operation two or three times.
Men do not indulge in a similar practice, and I have never
been able to understand why this different mode of bathing
should obtain in reference to the two sexes. In houses
possessing a bath-room the bath consists merely of a wooden
tub with a stove to heat the water. The bath is used by
the whole family in succession&mdash;father, mother, children,
servants. Shampooing also forms an important part of
the Japanese system of cleanliness. It is not, as in this
country, confined to the head, but approximates to what
we term massage, and consists in a rubbing of the muscles
of the body&mdash;a fact which not only has a beneficial effect
physically, but is also efficacious in the direction of cleanliness.</p>

<p>Nearly every house in Japan possesses a garden, and the
garden is a source of perpetual delight to every Japanese.
He is enabled to give full vent therein to his love of
flowers. Some critics have found fault with Japanese
gardens on account of their monotony. Miniature lakes,
grass plots, dwarfed trees, and trees clipped and trained
into representations of objects animate and inanimate are
the prevailing characteristics. A similar remark might,
however, be made in regard to the gardens of, say, London
suburban houses, with this exception&mdash;that the Japanese
gardens show infinitely more good taste on the part of the
cultivators of them. These little gardens throw a brightness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
into the life of the people which it is impossible to
estimate.</p>

<p>In the chapter which I have devoted to the religions of
the Japanese people, I have remarked that religion appears
to be losing its influence upon the educated classes of the
country, who are quickly developing into agnostics. No
such remark can, however, be made in reference to the
great mass of the Japanese people. For them religion is
an actuality. Take it out of their lives and you will take
much that makes their lives not only enjoyable but endurable.
As a writer on Japan has somewhat irreverently
observed, the Japanese &ldquo;is very chummy with heaven.
He just as readily invokes the aid of his household gods
in the pursuit of his amours as in less illegitimate aspirations.
He regards them as kind friends who will help,
rather than as severe censors who have to be propitiated.&rdquo;
The spiritual aspect of the Deity has not, I think, entered
at all into the conceptions of the ordinary Japanese. His
ideas in regard to God or the gods&mdash;his pantheon is a large
and a comprehensive one&mdash;are altogether anthropomorphic.
Every action of his life, however small, is in some way or
other connected with an unseen world. In this matter,
Buddhism and Shintoism have got rather mixed, and, as I
have elsewhere said, if the founder of Buddhism were reincarnated
in Japan to-day, he would find it difficult to
recognise his religion in some of the developments of
Buddhism as it exists in Japan. Nevertheless, this
anthropomorphic idea of God, however it may fit the
Japanese for the next world, undoubtedly comforts him
in this. The religious festivals, which are numerous, are
gala days in his life, and the services of religion bring him
undoubtedly much consolation. But he does not of necessity
go to a temple to conduct that uplifting of the heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which is, after all, the best service of man to the Creator.
Every house has its little shrine, and although some
superior persons may laugh at the act of burning a joss-stick,
or some other trivial act of worship, as merely
ignorant superstition, I think the unprejudiced man would
look rather at the motive which inspired the act. If this
poor ignorant native burns his joss-stick, makes his
offering of a cake, lights a lamp in front of an image, or
takes part in any other act which in effect means the
lifting up of his soul to something higher and greater than
himself that he can now only see through a glass darkly,
surely he ought not to be condemned. At any rate I
will pass no condemnation on him. Outside the accretions
which have undoubtedly come upon Buddhism and
Shintoism in the many centuries they have existed in
Japan, I desire once more to emphasise the fact, to
which I have previously made reference, that both these
religions have had, and I believe still have, a beneficial
effect, from a moral point of view, on the Japanese
people. There is nothing in their ethical code to which
the most censorious person can raise the slightest objection.
They have inculcated on the Japanese people
through all the ages, not only the necessity, but the
advisability of doing good. Buddhism, in particular, has
preached the doctrine of doing good, not only to one&rsquo;s
fellow-creatures but to the whole of animate nature.
These two religions have, in my opinion, placed the
ethical conceptions of the Japanese people on a high
plane.</p>

<p>In my remarks on the people of Japan I do not
think I can more effectually sum up their salient
characteristics than has been done by the writer of a
guide to that country. &ldquo;The courtly demeanour of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
people,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is a matter of remark with all who visit
Japan, and so universal is the studied politeness of all
classes that the casual observer would conclude that it
was innate and born of the nature of the people; and
probably the quality has become somewhat of a national
characteristic, having been held in such high esteem,
and so universally taught for so many centuries&mdash;at least,
it seems to be as natural for them to be polite and
formal as it is for them to breathe. Their religion
teaches the fundamental tenets of true politeness, in that
it inculcates the reverence to parents as one of the
highest virtues. The family circle fosters the germs of the
great national trait of ceremonious politeness. Deference
to age is universal with the young. The respect paid to
parents does not cease when the children are mature
men and women. It is considered a privilege as well
as an evidence of filial duty to study the wants and
wishes of the parents, even before the necessities of the
progeny of those who have households of their own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not think that it is necessary for me to add
much to these wise and pregnant remarks. The more
one studies the Japanese people, the more I think one&rsquo;s
admiration of them increases. They have, in my opinion,
in many respects arrived, probably as the result of the
accumulated experience of many ages, at a right perception
and conception of the philosophy of life. Judged
from the highest, and as I think only true, standpoint,
that is the standpoint of happiness not in a merely
material but in a spiritual form, they have reached a condition
that but few nations have yet attained. They may
provoke the pity of the man who believes in full diet and
plenty of it, and who fails to comprehend how a people
living on a meagre fare of fish and rice can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
contented, much less happy, but the Japanese in his
philosophy has realised a fact that happiness is something
other than material, and that a man or woman can
be largely independent of the accidentals of life and
can attain a realisation of true happiness by keeping
under the, too often, supremacy of matter over mind in
the average human being.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>TRADE&mdash;COMMERCE&mdash;AND INDUSTRIES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OTHING is perhaps so strongly indicative of the
progress that Japan has made as the record of her
trade and commerce. I have no intention of inflicting on
my readers a mass of figures, but I shall have to give a few
in order to convey some idea as to the country&rsquo;s material
development of recent years. Japan, it must be recollected,
is in her youth in respect of everything connected with
commerce and industry. When the country was isolated
it exported and imported practically nothing, and its productions
were simply such as were necessary for the
inhabitants, then far less numerous than at present. When
the Revolution took place trade and commerce were still
at a very low ebb, and the Japanese connected with trade
was looked upon with more or less of contempt, the soldier&rsquo;s
and the politician&rsquo;s being the only careers held much in
esteem. For innumerable centuries the chief industry of
Japan was agriculture, and even to-day more than half
of the population is engaged thereon. Partly owing to
religious influences, and partly from other causes, the
mass of the people have been, and still are in effect,
vegetarians.</p>

<p>The present trade of Japan is in startling contrast with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that of her near neighbour China, which, with an area
about twenty-three times greater, and a population nearly
nine times as large, has actually a smaller volume of
exports. All the statistics available in reference to Japan&rsquo;s
trade, commerce, and industries point to the enormous and
annually increasing development of the country. Indeed,
the trade has marvellously increased of recent years. Since
1890 the annual value of Japan&rsquo;s exports has risen from
&pound;5,000,000 to &pound;35,000,000, the imports from &pound;8,000,000
to &pound;44,000,000. That the imports will continue in similar
progression, or indeed to anything like the same amount,
I do not believe. Japan of recent years has imported
machinery, largely from Europe and America, and used it
as patterns to be copied or improved upon by her own
workmen. Out of 25 cotton-mills, for example, in Osaka,
the machinery for one had been imported from the United
States. The rest the Japanese have made themselves from
the imported pattern. There were also in Osaka recently
30 flour-mills ready for shipment to the wheat regions of
Manchuria. One of these mills had been imported from
America, while the remaining 29 have been constructed in
Osaka at a cost for each of not more than one-fifth that
paid for the imported mill.</p>

<p>Shortly after peace had been declared between Russia
and Japan, the Marquis Ito is reported to have said to
Mr. McKinley: &ldquo;You need not be afraid that we will
allow Japanese labourers to come to the United States.
We need them at home. In a couple of months we
will bring home a million men from Manchuria. We are
going to teach them all how to manufacture everything in
the world with the best labour-saving machinery to be
found. Instead of sending you cheap labour we will sell
you American goods cheaper than you can manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
them yourselves.&rdquo; The Japanese Government seems to
some extent to be going in for a policy of State Socialism.
The tobacco trade in the Empire is now entirely
controlled by the Government. The Tobacco Law
extinguished private tobacco dealers and makers, the
Government took over whatever factories it deemed suitable
for the purpose, built others, and now makes a profit
of about &pound;3,000,000 sterling annually, while the tobacco
is said to be of a superior quality and the workmen better
paid than was the case under private enterprise. How far
Japan intends to go in the direction of State Socialism
I am not in a position to say. Many modern Japanese
statesmen are quite convinced of the fact that the private
exploitation of industry is a great evil and one that ought
to be put a stop to. On the other hand, there are
Japanese statesmen who are firmly convinced that the
State control of industries can only result in the destruction
of individual initiative and genius, with the inevitable
result of reducing everybody to a dead level of incompetence.
In this matter Japan will have, as other nations
have had, to work out her own salvation. In the process
of experiment many mistakes will no doubt be made, but
Japan starts with this advantage in respect of State
Socialism, precisely as in regard to her Army and Navy&mdash;that
her statesmen, her leading public men, her great
thinkers, have no prejudices or preconceived ideas. All
they desire is that the nation as a whole shall boldly
advance on that path of progress by the lines which shall
best serve to place the country in a commanding position
among the Great Powers of the world, and at the same
time to promote the happiness, comfort, and prosperity of
the people.</p>

<p>The Japanese are great in imitation, but they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
greater perhaps in their powers of adaptation. They have
so far shown a peculiar faculty for fitting to Japanese
requirements and conditions the machinery, science,
industry, &amp;c., necessary to their proper development.
Japan is without doubt now keenly alive, marshalling all
her industrial forces in the direction of seeking to become
supreme in the trade and commerce of the Far East. The
aim of Japanese statesmen is to make their country
self-productive and self-sustaining. We may, I think,
accordingly look forward to the time, not very far distant,
when Japan will cease to import machinery and other
foreign products for which there has hitherto been a
brisk demand, when she will build her own warships and
merchant steamers, as she now partially does, and
generally be largely independent of those Western Powers
of which she has heretofore been such a good customer.</p>

<p>At the present time the chief manufactures of the
country are silk, cotton, cotton yarn, paper, glass, porcelain,
and Japan ware, matches and bronzes, while shipbuilding
has greatly developed of recent years. The
principal imports are raw cotton, metals, wool, drugs,
rails and machinery generally, as well as sugar and,
strange to say, rice. Japan exports silk, cotton, tea, coal,
camphor and, let me add, matches and curios. The trade
in the latter has assumed considerable proportions, and I
fear I must add that much of what is exported is made
exclusively for the European market. According to the
latest figures, the country&rsquo;s annual exports amounted to
about &pound;35,000,000, and its imports to about &pound;44,000,000.
I venture to prophesy that these figures will ere long be
largely inverted.</p>

<p>Silk is the most important item of Japan&rsquo;s foreign trade.
The rearing of silkworms has been assiduously undertaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
from time immemorial, or &ldquo;the ages eternal&rdquo; according to
some Japanese historians. Like so many other arts and
industries of the country, silkworms are believed to have
been introduced from China. For some time prior to the
opening of Japan to European trade and influences the
silk industry had rather languished owing to the enforcement
of certain sumptuary laws confining the wearing of
silk garments to a select class of the community, but so
soon as Japan discarded her policy of isolation from the
rest of the world the production of and demand for silk
rapidly increased, and the trade in it has now assumed
considerable dimensions. Strange to say, silk is still in
Japan what linen was at one time in the North of Ireland&mdash;a
by-industry of the farmer, a room in his house being
kept as a rearing chamber for the silkworms, which are
carefully looked after by his family. According to official
returns, there are rather more than two and a half million
families so engaged, and nearly half a million silk manufacturers.
The largest part of the silk exported goes to
the United States of America. Closely allied with the
production of silk is the mulberry-tree, the leaves of which
form the staple food of the silkworm. This plant is
cultivated with great care throughout the country, and
indeed there are many mulberry farms entirely devoted to
the culture of the tree and the conservation of its leaves.</p>

<p>Rice, as I have elsewhere stated, forms the principal
article of food of the Japanese people. Japan at present
does not produce quite sufficient rice for the consumption
of her population, and a large quantity has, accordingly,
to be imported. The danger of this for an island country
has been quite as often emphasised by Japanese statesmen
as the similar danger in respect of the wheat supply of
Great Britain has been by English economists. Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
practical steps have been taken on the initiative of the
Japanese Government in the direction of improving the
cultivation of rice, the irrigation of the fields, &amp;c. As time
goes on no doubt the food of the people will become more
varied. Indeed, there has been a movement in that direction,
especially in the large towns. A nation which largely
lives on one article of diet, the production of which is
subject to the vicissitudes of good and bad harvests, is, it
must be admitted, not in a satisfactory position in reference
to the food of its people.</p>

<p>If rice is the national food, tea is emphatically the
national beverage, despite the large consumption of sak&eacute;
and the increasing consumption of the really excellent beer
now brewed in Japan. Like most other things, the tea-shrub
is said to have been imported into Japan from China.
Almost since the opening of the country, the United
States has been Japan&rsquo;s best customer in respect of tea,
and she has from time to time fallen into line with the
requirements of the United States Government in regard
to the quality of tea permitted to be imported into that
country. For instance, when, in 1897, the United States
Legislature passed a law forbidding the importation of tea
of inferior quality and providing for the inspection of all
imported tea by a fixed standard sample, the Tea Traders
Association of Japan established tea inspection offices in
Yokohama and other ports, and all the tea exported from
the country was and still is passed through these offices.
The tea is rigidly tested, and if it comes up to the required
standard is shipped in bond to the United States. The
quality of the tea is thus amply guaranteed, and it, accordingly,
commands a high price in the American Continent.
The value of the tea exported to the United States
amounts to something like &pound;1,200,000, and there are no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
signs of any falling off in the demand for it. Canada is
also a good customer of Japan for the same article, but
Great Britain and the other European countries at present
take no Japanese tea. I do not know why this is the case
as the tea is really excellent, and it has, as regards what is
exported, the decided advantage of being inspected by
experts and the quality guaranteed. The tea industry is
undoubtedly one of great national importance, the total
annual production amounting to about 65,000,000 pounds,
the greater portion of which is, of course, consumed in the
country.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the importance of Japanese
arboriculture, and to the steps taken by the Japanese
Government in reference to the administration of forests
and the planting with trees of various parts of the country
not suitable for agriculture. The State at the present time
owns about 54,000,000 acres of forests, which are palpably
a very great national asset. I may mention that the
petroleum industry is growing in Japan. The quantity of
petroleum in the country is believed to be very great, and
every year new fields are being developed. The consumption
of oil by the people is considerable, and it is hoped
that ere long Japan will be able to produce all that she
requires. The petroleum is somewhat crude, providing
about 50 per cent. of burning oil.</p>

<p>Tobacco, as I have elsewhere remarked, is now a State
monopoly, and forms a considerable item in the State
revenue. The quality has much improved since the
manufacture of it has ceased to be a private industry. The
Japanese are inveterate smokers, and the intervention of
the State in this matter, although it has been criticised by
political economists in the country and out of it, and is
undoubtedly open to criticism from some points of view,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
has, I think, been justified by results. The making of
sugar from beetroot has been attempted in Japan, but the
results have not been over-successful. The efforts in this
direction are, however, being persisted in, and it is hoped
that, especially in Formosa, the beet&mdash;sugar industry may
develop in importance.</p>

<p>The manufacture of paper in Japan has long been an
important national industry. Paper has been and still is
used there for many purposes for which it has never been
utilised in European countries. Originally it was largely
made from rice, and the mulberry shrub has also been
used for paper manufacture. The rise and development
of a newspaper press in Japan and the impetus given to
printing has, of course, largely increased the demand for
paper. This is being met by the adaptation of other
vegetable products for the purpose of making paper, and it
seems quite certain that Japan will be totally independent
of any importation of foreign paper to meet the great and
greatly increasing demand for that article in the country.</p>

<p>Salt is, I may remark, a Government monopoly in Japan.
No one except the Government, or some person licensed by
the Government, is allowed to import salt from abroad,
while no one can manufacture salt without Government
permission. Salt made by salt manufacturers is purchased
by the Government, which sells it at a fixed price. This
particular monopoly has only recently been established,
and the reason put forward for it is a desire to improve
and develop the salt industry and at the same time to
add to the national revenue. Whether a monopoly in
what is a necessary of life is economically defensible is a
question, to my mind, hardly open to argument. That the
revenue of the country will benefit by the salt monopoly is
unquestionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
As might have been expected, the opening up of Japan
to Western influences has induced or produced, <i>inter alia</i>,
some Western forms of political and social and, indeed,
socialistic associations. The antagonism between capital
and labour and the many vexed and intricate questions
involved in the quarrel are already beginning to make
themselves felt in Japan. It was, I suppose, inevitable.
Labour is an important factor in an industrial nation like
Japan, and there is already heard the cry&mdash;call it fact or
fallacy as you choose&mdash;with which we are now so familiar
in this country and on the Continent, that labour is the
source of all wealth. Japan will no doubt, like other
countries, sooner or later have to face a solution of the
problems involved in these recurring disputes and this
apparently deep-rooted antagonism between the possessors
of wealth and the possessors of muscle. Already many
associations have been established whose aim and object is
to voice the sentiments of labour and assert its rights.
Indeed, there is a newspaper, the <i>Labour World</i>, the champion
of the rights of the Japanese workmen. So far the
law in Japan does not regard with as tolerant an eye as is
the case in this country labour demonstrations and the
occasionally reckless oratory of labour champions. The
police regulations forbid the working classes embarking in
collective movements and demonstrating against their
employers in the matter of wages and working hours. A
suggestion of a strike of workmen is officially regarded
with an unfriendly eye, and strikes themselves, picketing,
and various other Western methods of coercing employers
to come round to the views of the employed, would not at
present be tolerated in Japan. No doubt these Western
devices will assert themselves in time. The attempt to
keep down the effective outcome of labour organisation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a country with an enormous labour population is not
likely to be successful for long. Socialism is making great
progress in Japan, and the State has, whether consciously
or not, given it a certain amount of countenance by the
steps it has taken in reference to the tobacco and salt
industries, &amp;c. The extent to which newspapers are now
read in Japan&mdash;a matter I refer to more fully in another
chapter&mdash;will undoubtedly tend to mould public opinion to
such a degree that no Government could afford to resist it.</p>

<p>The trade, commerce, and industries of Japan appear to
me to be, on the whole, in a healthy and flourishing condition.
In them, and of course in her industrious population,
Japan possesses a magnificent asset. The country is
rich in undeveloped resources of various kinds, the people
are patriotic to a degree, and I feel sure that the additional
burdens which the recent war with Russia has for the
time entailed will be cheerfully borne. I am confident,
moreover, that under the wise guidance of the Emperor
and her present statesmen Japan will make successful
efforts to liquidate her public debt, to relieve herself of her
foreign liabilities, and generally to proceed untrammelled
and unshackled on that path of progress and material
development that, I believe, lies before her, and which
will, I am sure, at no far-distant date place her securely
and permanently in the position of one of the Great World
Powers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>JAPAN&rsquo;S FINANCIAL BURDENS AND RESOURCES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are a good many people, some so-called
financial experts among the number, who are of
opinion, and have expressed themselves to that effect,
that the financial position of Japan is an unsound one.
They depict that country as weighed down with a load of
debt, mostly incurred for her warlike operations against
Russia, and the revenue as largely mortgaged for the
payment of the interest on that debt. Some of these
experts have told us that the facility with which Japan
was able to raise loans on comparatively moderate terms
in the European money-markets, and the rush that was
made by investors to subscribe to her loans, are matters
which must have a baneful effect on the rulers of Japan.
These latter, we are assured, found themselves in the
position not only of being able to raise money easily, but
of positively having to refuse money which was forced
upon them by eager investors when the Japanese loans
were put upon the market. The result was, so it has
been said, to encourage extravagance in expenditure and
to lead Japan to suppose that whenever she wanted money
for any purpose she had only to come to Europe and
ask for it. The financial experts who so argue, if such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
puerile assertions can be dignified by the name of argument,
talk as if Japan were like a child with a new toy.
The Japanese statesmen&mdash;in which term I of course include
the Mikado, one of the world&rsquo;s greatest statesmen&mdash;are by
no means so simple as some of these financial experts
would have us believe. Indeed, I will go further, and
venture to assert that the statesmen are far more astute
than the experts. The former emphatically know what
they are about, financially and otherwise, and they are
assuredly in no need of any Occidental giving them a
lead in the matter. If I desired to adduce any evidence
on that head I need only point to the <i>Financial and
Economical Annual of Japan</i>, published every year at
the Government printing office in Tokio. This exhaustive
work deals with the different departments of Government.
The section I have before me, which is for the year 1905,
treats of the Department of Finance and it certainly serves,
and very effectively serves, to show that the Japanese are
not, as they so often have been depicted, children in
matters of this kind. This Government handbook is not
only exhaustive but illuminative. Published in English,
everything of which it treats is explained in simple and
concise language. There is an entire absence of that
official jargon which tends, even if it is not intended, to
render Government publications in this country unintelligible
to the ordinary reader. The plain man who
peruses this Japanese year-book can at least understand
it, and he will, among other things, grasp the fact that
the Japanese have got the whole question of finance in
all its ramifications at their fingers&rsquo; ends.</p>

<p>The total National Debt of Japan in 1905 amounted to
994,437,340 yen, or, roughly, &pound;100,000,000 sterling&mdash;a sum
which the publication I have referred to works out to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
at the rate of 19.548 yen, or about 39s. per head of the
population. Of the debt some &pound;43,000,000 was incurred
to defray a part of the cost of the war with Russia. As
an indication of the estimate of the credit of Japan within
her own territory as well as abroad, I may record the fact
that the Exchequer Bonds which were issued in the
country in 1904 and 1905 for the purpose of defraying
the extraordinary expenses of the war were largely over-subscribed,
the first issue to the extent of 452 per cent.,
the second 322 per cent., the third 246 per cent., and the
fourth 490 per cent.&mdash;a record surely! Abroad Japan&rsquo;s
loans were no less successful. The three issues made
in Europe during the war were literally rushed for by the
investing public, with the result that whereas in May, 1904,
Japan offered for subscription a loan of &pound;10,000,000,
the issue price being &pound;93 10s. and the rate of interest
6 per cent., in March, 1905, despite the fact of two previous
loans and the exhaustion of the country incidental to a
long and expensive war, she was able to place on the
market a loan of thirty millions at 4&frac12; per cent. interest,
the issue price being &pound;90.</p>

<p>A National Debt which amounts to less than &pound;2 per
head of the population compares very favourably with
that of Great Britain, which totals up to something like
&pound;19 per head, leaving out of account the immense and
yearly growing indebtedness of our great cities and towns.
Furthermore, almost the whole of the National Debt of
this country, as of the European Powers generally, has
been incurred not only for unproductive, but as a matter of
fact for destructive purposes. The vast loans of Europe
have been raised for the purpose of waging bloody wars,
some at least of which history has pronounced to have
been gigantic, not to say wicked, blunders. Much of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
National Debt of Japan, on the contrary, has been incurred
for useful, productive, and even remunerative purposes&mdash;improving
the means of transport, constructing railways,
&amp;c. The various loans outstanding up to the year 1887,
on which Japan was paying very high rates of interest, as
much as 9 per cent. on one foreign loan, were in that year
converted and consolidated by the issue of a loan bearing
interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum&mdash;a proceeding
which materially improved Japan&rsquo;s financial position and
demonstrated that her credit stood high.</p>

<p>The war with China in 1894-5 necessitated fresh borrowing
to the amount of over &pound;12,000,000. Subsequent
loans were issued in order to extend the railway system
of the country and so develop its trade, for such
public works as the establishment of a steel foundry, the
extension of the telephone system, the introduction of
the leaf tobacco monopoly, for the development of Formosa
and, another most important matter, the redemption of
paper-money. In the early days of her expansion Japan
suffered greatly from the evils of inconvertible paper-money
and strenuous efforts had for a long time been made
by the Government for the redemption of the paper-money
and the improvement of the general financial condition.
In 1890 it was found that the reserve fund kept in
the Treasury for the exchange of paper-money of 1 yen
and upwards was insufficient to meet the demand. To
meet this emergency, the maximum amount of convertible
bank-notes issued by the Bank of Japan against securities
was increased from 70,000,000 yen (&pound;7,169,927) to
85,000,000 yen (&pound;8,706,340), of which sum 22,000,000 yen
were advanced to the Government without interest. This
sum added to the original reserve fund of 10,000,000 yen
(&pound;1,024,275) was employed for completing the redemption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of paper-money of 1 yen and upward. Subsequent
loans for the purposes of the war with Russia I have
already referred to. Besides funded Japan has also,
like this country, had experience of unfunded debt in the
shape of Treasury Bills, temporary loans from the Bank
of Japan, &amp;c. Financial operations of this kind are,
however, I imagine, necessary for all Governments to
meet current expenses. To briefly recapitulate Japan&rsquo;s
indebtedness and borrowings generally up to the end of
March, 1905, these amounted to, in all, &pound;140,045,030, of
which sum &pound;38,187,369 has from time to time been paid
off, leaving a balance of &pound;101,857,661 owing by the
nation.</p>

<p>When we consider that for this large, but not unduly
large, sum Japan has waged two considerable wars, and
raised herself to the position of a great naval and military
Power, that she has developed and organised a magnificent
Army, provided herself with a strong, efficient, and
thoroughly up-to-date Navy, has constructed railways and
public works, and generally has placed herself in a
capital position to work out her own destiny free from
the fear of foreign interference, I altogether fail to see how
she can be accused of financial extravagance. There is
certainly no extravagance in the administration of her
finances. London might, I suggest, learn much from
Tokio in this matter. The system of financial check and
thorough and rapid audit of public accounts is in Japan as
near perfection as anything of the kind can be. Though
the late war did produce, as I suppose all wars do, peculation,
most of it was discovered and the punishment of
the culprits was sharp and decisive. There was no opportunity
for financial scandals in the campaign with Russia
such as occurred during the South African War. Every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
country, of course, produces rogues, and war seems, <i>inter
alia</i>, to breed roguery on a large scale, but in the Japanese
methods of finance the checks are so effective that roguery
in the public services has a bad time of it in war as well
as in peace.</p>

<p>As I have already remarked, I am of opinion the debt of
Japan is by no means excessive, especially in view of the
fact that a large part of it has been devoted to purposes
which are profitable. The debt works out, as I have
shown, at something under &pound;2 per head of the population,
and that population is steadily increasing. That Japan is
well able to pay the interest on her debt there can be no
question whatever, and that when the present debt becomes
due for redemption she will be able to raise the necessary
funds for that purpose on terms even more favourable than
those at which she has hitherto placed her loans I am
confident. I must emphasise the fact, since so many
persons seem to be oblivious of it, that this is no mushroom
South American Republic borrowing money merely
for the purpose of spending it on very unproductive and
occasionally very doubtful objects, but a Great World
Power sensible of its obligations, sensible likewise of the
policy and necessity of maintaining the national credit, and
confident that the national resources and the patriotism
of its people will enable it not only to bear the present
financial burdens but even greater, should these be found
necessary for the defence of the country or for its
development.</p>

<p>The ability of a nation as of an individual to discharge
its debts depends of course upon its resources. No man
possessing even a perfunctory knowledge of the resources
of Japan would surely venture to express alarm at the
increase in her debt and scepticism as to her being able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
meet the annual interest on that debt as well as the
constantly increasing expenses of administration. The
resources of the country have, in my opinion, as yet
scarcely been realised, and certainly have not been anything
like fully developed. And when I use the word
resources I do not employ it as it is so often employed in
respect of minerals, although the mineral wealth of Japan
is considerable. Her resources, as I estimate them, are to
be found in her large and rapidly increasing population&mdash;a
population perhaps the most industrious in the world,
persevering, enterprising, methodical, and performing,
whatever be its appointed task, that task with all its
might as a labour of love, in fact, not as the irksome toil
of the worker who is a worker simply because he can be
nothing else. It is this great industrial hive which in the
near future will supply China and other Eastern countries
with all, or nearly all, those articles they now obtain elsewhere.
What I may term the European industries of
Japan have of recent years been largely developed or
evolved. Take, for example, an item, insignificant in one
way&mdash;that of matches. In 1904 matches to the value of
9,763,860 yen, or, roughly, one million sterling, were
exported, and, strange to relate, European clothing to
the value of 287,464 yen.</p>

<p>The glib people who talk about Japan biting off more
than she can chew, and with a light heart borrowing money
she will find a difficulty in repaying, have apparently not
grasped the fact that Japan possesses many very eminent
financiers who have quite as much, if not more, claim to be
considered financial experts than some of those gentlemen
who pose in that capacity here in England. The Japanese
financiers have, moreover, the advantage of an intimate
knowledge of their own country and its potentialities.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The Japanese Government has always had the benefit of
the advice of these singularly able men, and the result
has been that its financial operations of recent years at any
rate have invariably been well organised and skilfully and
economically effected. I cannot speak too highly of the
capacity shown by the Japanese in everything relating to
banking. The Banks&mdash;of course I refer to the National
Banks and not to the European Banks having branches
in the country&mdash;have very quickly attained a high status
in the International Banking world, and are undoubtedly
on a very firm financial basis. And there are many great
houses in Japan which, although not ostensibly bankers,
cannot be left out of consideration in any remarks on this
head. They occupy a position somewhat analogous to
that of the Rothschilds in this country. Let me take for
example the house of Mitsui, the name of which constantly
crops up in Japanese finance.</p>

<p>The history of this ancient house has much that is
picturesque about it, reminding one of the old merchant
princes of Venice. The family originally belonged to the
Jujiwara clan, and its origin is traced back to a certain
Mitsui who lived as a feudal lord in the fifteenth century.
At the time of the fall of the Ashikaja Shogun he lived in
a state of perpetual war, and the god of war was not propitious
to him. He retired to a neighbouring village and
became the overlord of the district. He was succeeded
by his son, who removed to Matsusuzaka, where he settled
down as a private citizen and man of business, and laid
the foundations of the present Mitsui house. In the
middle of the sixteenth century his descendant became
a merchant. His son moved to Kyoto, where he started
a large goods store, which is represented in Tokio to-day
by the Mitsui Hofukuten. Subsequently, at the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the seventeenth century, a member of the same house
invented and introduced the system of retailing for cash,
which was an absolute revolution of business methods at
that time in Japan. In addition to that he organised an
excellent system for the remittance of money from one
part of the country to the other, as also a carrier&rsquo;s business&mdash;two
very remarkable facts when one remembers in what
a primitive and elementary condition of development the
monetary business of Japan was at that period. In the
year 1687 the Mitsuis were appointed by the Government
purveyors and controllers of the public exchange, and in
recognition of the excellent manner in which the duties
were performed, they were given the grant of a large
estate in Yeddo.</p>

<p>In 1723 the head of the family, carrying out the verbal
wishes of his father, assembled his brothers and sisters
and then and there drew up in writing a set of family
rules which have ever since been practically the articles of
association of the house of Mitsui. These rules embodied
on business-like lines and in business-like language the
principle that the family and not the individual forms
the ultimate union in Eastern life. It was not one or the
other of the six brothers of which the family consisted
when these rules were drawn up that was to trade, but the
whole family as one unit. There was to be unlimited
liability as far as the property of each one was concerned,
and the profits of all were to be divided. This agreement
is the identical one under which the great house of Mitsui
is run to-day. Under it the family prospered exceedingly,
so that when Japan decided to take on some portion of
Western civilisation, the Mitsuis acted as the principal
financial agents of the Government, and it was mainly
owing to the enormous financial resources of the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
placed by them at the disposal of the Government that
the country was enabled at the period of the revolution to
pass successfully through what might have been a most
disastrous crisis. As some reward for the great services
rendered at the time, the present head of the house was
created a peer. Since the opening of Japan to Western
influence the business of the Mitsuis has enormously
increased, and has been extended in various directions.
In 1876 their money exchange business was converted
into a Bank on the joint stock system, but with unlimited
liability as far as the Mitsui family was concerned. In the
same year, for the purpose of engaging in general foreign
trade, the Mitsui Bussan Kwiasha was formed, better
known in Europe and America as Mitsui &amp; Co. In 1899
the family acquired from the Government the concession
of the Meike coal-mines, and there was then formed the
Mitsui Kaishan, or Mining Department, which has the
management of this mining concession together with
many others which have since been acquired.</p>

<p>To-day the house of Mitsui consists of eleven families
under a system of joint liability bound together by the
old rules drawn up close upon two centuries back. The
wealth of the collective families is unquestionably great,
and the confidence of the people of Japan in this great
financial firm is shown by the immense amount of money
it holds on deposit. In one or other branches of their
varied businesses they give employment to a very large
number of persons. They have initiated an exceedingly
interesting system of insurance for their employees. Each
is allowed 10 per cent. interest on his wages up to three
years on condition of its being deposited in the Mitsui
Bank, with the proviso that the sum shall be forfeited in
case of the embezzlement of any of the Company&rsquo;s money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
During the late war, as well as in that with China, the
Mitsui house had immense transactions with the Government
in providing war material, steamers for transport,
supplies, &amp;c., and their magnificent organisation enabled
them to carry out their various undertakings without the
slightest hitch. I may also add that the name of Mitsui
headed the various charitable funds which were started in
the country in connection with the war. I am sure that
this necessarily imperfect sketch of this famous Japanese
house will convince my readers of the fact that in finance,
as in other respects, Japan has already shown a capacity
for holding her own with Western nations.</p>

<p>I have headed this chapter &ldquo;Japan&rsquo;s Financial Burdens
and Resources,&rdquo; but I am not quite sure that the word
&ldquo;burdens&rdquo; is not a misnomer. Japan appears to me&mdash;and
I may claim to have studied the matter with some
little attention&mdash;to have no financial burdens, if burdens
be taken to mean something that is inconveniently felt,
that is difficult to carry. There is here no people weighed
down under the crushing incubus of debt. There is a
springiness and alertness, a go-ahead energy about the
nation&mdash;symptoms not usually connected with the carrying
of burdens. Japan seems to me to be in somewhat
the same position in regard to finance as France was
after the close of the war with Germany when the former
nation found itself saddled with a tremendous debt
incurred for war expenditure and the indemnity which
had to be paid to the conquering nation. The fact,
however, as we all know, instead of depressing the French
people seems to have put the whole country on its
mettle, with the result that the heavy interest of the
enormous debt was easily met and effective steps taken
to reduce the principal. The borrowings of Japan in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Europe in the future are likely to be small, because
she will be able to obtain what she needs at home, and
provided she is not drawn into any war she will find
her expanding revenue sufficient not only for the
current expenses of administration as well as for the
interest on her debt, but over and above all this enabling
her year by year to provide a sinking fund which will
in due course materially reduce even if it does not entirely
extinguish the national indebtedness. In my opinion
Japan can look forward to its financial future with
equanimity. In regard to its financial past it has the
satisfaction of thinking that heavy in one sense though
its financial obligations be they have not at any rate been
squandered for unworthy purposes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>EDUCATION</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N England a vast amount was last year heard respecting
education. Speakers on platforms and writers in
newspapers and other periodical literature day by day
and week by week for many months kept pouring forth
words, words, words on this matter. It is not my
intention to refer at all beyond what I have said to the
somewhat lively education controversy in England which
even as I write is by no means ended. Any such reference
would be out of place in a book of this kind, and even
were it not I confess I have no inclination whatever to
rush into this particular fray. But it seems to me a
curious fact that other countries, Japan amongst the
number, have long since settled, and apparently settled
satisfactorily, a problem which here in England is still
under discussion, acrid discussion, and is yet quite
evidently far from being permanently solved. The
provisions and arrangements a nation has made for the
education of its youth are, to my mind, an excellent test
of the precise standard to which its civilisation has
attained; because the future of a nation is with its
youth, and that future must largely depend on the
extent to and the manner in which its youth have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
taught not only all those subjects which are commonly
classified as knowledge but their duties and responsibilities
as citizens. Judged by this test, Japan has every right
to rank high among the nations of the world. And it
can also be said of her in this matter that the education
of her people is no new thing. It is not one among
the many things she has learned from the West.
Education was in vogue in Japan when that country was
isolated from the rest of the world. Certainly Japan&rsquo;s
contact with Europe and America has vastly improved her
educational system, enabling her, as it has done, to utilise
to the full the great advance there has been in scientific
knowledge of every description during the last half-century
or so. But, as far back as the seventh century, if history
or tradition be correct, an educational code was promulgated
in Japan. Certainly this code was limited in its
application to certain classes, but education was gradually
extended throughout the country, and even in days
somewhat remote from the present time every member
of the Samurai class was expected to include the three
R&rsquo;s, or the Japanese equivalent of them, in his curriculum.
The ordinary Samurai was, in fact, as regards reading
and writing an educated man at a time when British
Generals and even British Sovereigns were somewhat
hazy in regard to their orthography and caligraphy.</p>

<p>Soon after the Revolution of 1868 a Board of Education
was instituted in Japan, and the whole educational system
of the country&mdash;because one had existed under the rule
of a Tycoon&mdash;was taken in hand and reorganised. Three
years later a separate Department of Education was
formed at a time almost synonymous with the setting
up of School Boards in England. As soon as it got
itself into working order the Education Department
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
despatched a number of specially selected Japanese to
various European countries as well as to the United
States of America to inquire into and report upon the
system of education in existence and its suitability for
adaptation or adoption in Japan. When these representatives
returned from their mission and sent in their
reports a code was compiled and the Mikado, in promulgating
it, declared the aims of his Government to be
that education should be so diffused throughout the
country that eventually there might not be a village
with an ignorant family nor a family with an ignorant
member. It was a noble ideal, and I may remark that,
though of course it has not been realised in all its
fulness and probably will not be for very many years
to come, it has been to a larger extent attained than a
somewhat similar ideal which the late Mr. Forster is
supposed to have entertained in reference to the effect
of the Education Act which established a system of
compulsory education for England and Wales.</p>

<p>In succeeding years various changes were made in
the system of national education, and in 1883 that
which now exists was brought into force. This is in
effect compulsory education. Since education was first
organised on any plan in Japan the number under
instruction has steadily risen, and at present more than
90 per cent. of the children regularly attend school.
In 1873 the number was 1,180,000; it is now over
5,000,000. There are about 29,000 primary schools, of
which about 6,500 are higher primary schools with a
million pupils. The total cost of the primary schools
is somewhere about &pound;3,000,000.</p>

<p>The question will no doubt be asked, What kind of
education do these 5,000,000 pupils receive, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
what extent is it adapted to make them good citizens
of a great Empire? The subjects taught in the ordinary
primary schools embrace morals, the Japanese language,
arithmetic and gymnastics. One or more subjects, such
as drawing, singing, or manual work may be added,
and, in schools for females, sewing. In the higher primary
schools the subjects of instruction include morals, the
Japanese language, arithmetic, Japanese history, geography,
science, drawing, singing, and gymnastics, and,
in schools for females, sewing. Besides these agriculture,
commerce, and manual work, as well as the English
language, are optional subjects. The moral lessons taught
in these schools, I may remark, are not based upon any
particular religious doctrines or dogmas, but are entirely
and absolutely secular.</p>

<p>Children have to be 6 years of age before commencing
their scholastic education, and have to remain at school
until they have attained 14 years. The parents or
guardians of children are compelled to send them to
school to complete, as a minimum of education, the
ordinary primary school course. Education in the higher
primary schools is not compulsory, and it is, accordingly,
a pleasing fact that 60 per cent. of those children who
have passed through the ordinary schools voluntarily go
to the higher primary schools.</p>

<p>Every municipal or rural community is compelled to
maintain one or more primary schools sufficient, as regards
size and the number of the staff, to educate all the
children in the district. The establishment of higher
primary schools is voluntary, and that so many of them
are in existence is ample proof that the benefit of higher
education is fully appreciated in Japan. Instruction in
all the schools is practically free. No fee may be charged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
save with the consent of the local governor, and when one
is imposed it must not exceed the equivalent of 5d. per
month in a town school and half that sum in a rural school.</p>

<p>As regards secondary education, it is compulsory for
one school to be established in each of the forty-seven
prefectures into which Japan is divided. The course of
study at the secondary schools extends over five years,
with an optional supplementary course limited to twelve
months. The curriculum of the secondary school embraces
morals, the Japanese and Chinese languages, one
foreign language, history and geography, mathematics,
natural history, physics and chemistry, the elements of
law and political economy, drawing, singing, gymnastics,
and drills. The course of study is uniform in all Japanese
schools. Candidates for admission to the secondary
schools must be over 12 years of age, and have completed
the second year&rsquo;s course of the higher primary
school. There are about three hundred of the secondary
schools in existence&mdash;a number, as will be seen, six times
as large as that obliged to be established by law. The
pupils number over a hundred thousand and the cost
approximates &pound;500,000.</p>

<p>There are also 170 high schools for girls besides normal
schools in each prefecture designed to train teachers for
the primary and secondary schools. The course of study
in these schools is for men four years, for women three
years. The whole of the pupils&rsquo; expenses, including the
cost of their board and lodging, is paid out of local funds.
There are also higher normal schools designed to train
teachers for the ordinary normal schools. It will thus be
seen that there is a systematic course of education for
what I may term the common people in Japan, extending
from the higher normal to the ordinary primary school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
There are besides in Japan higher schools, the object of
which is to prepare young men for a University education.
The expense of these schools is entirely borne by
the State. Japan prides herself, and justly, in being
unique in the possession of such schools. The course of
study in them extends over three years and is split up
into three departments. The pupils select the particular
department into which they desire to enter, and their
selection, of course, depends on the precise course of study
they intend to take up on entering the University. The
first department is for those who propose to study law
or literature, the second for those who mean to go in
for engineering, science, or agriculture, and the third for
aspirants as medical men. Candidates for admission to
these schools must be over 17 years of age and have
completed the secondary school course.</p>

<p>A reference to these higher schools naturally leads up
to the Imperial University of Tokio, as well as the
kindred University at Kyoto. There are six colleges in
the former, viz., law, medicine, engineering, literature,
science, and agriculture, while Kyoto University possesses
four colleges, viz., law, medicine, literature and science, and
engineering. When the Imperial University was established
almost all the Professors therein were Europeans
or Americans, but there has been a material alteration
in this respect, and now the foreign Professors are few.
Most of the Japanese instructors have, however, been
educated abroad. The course of study extends over four
years in the case of students of law and medicine, and
three years in the case of students of other subjects. There
is not the same freedom in regard to study as exists at
Oxford, Cambridge, and some other more or less leisurely
seats of learning. In the Japanese Universities the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
students have to enter upon a regular prescribed course
of study with some few optional subjects. The Universities
confer degrees in law, medicine, engineering, literature,
science, and agriculture. The examinations leading
up to and for the degrees are much more severe than
those in any University in this country, with the possible
exception of that of London. It may interest my readers
to learn that the largest number of degrees are taken in
law, the smallest in science. We have heard a great deal
of recent years respecting technical education in Great
Britain, which many persons suggest is at a very low ebb.
For what is in one sense a new country, Japan seems
to have taken steps to provide an excellent system of
technical education. There are a small number of State
higher technical schools, agricultural, commercial, and
industrious. Technical schools of lower grades are maintained
by prefectures and urban bodies, and they receive
grants in aid from national funds. There are in all about
four hundred technical schools in the country. The few
facts respecting education in Japan which I have put as
tersely as possible before my readers, should, I think, convince
them of the fact that in regard to this all-important
question Japan has made and is making vigorous efforts&mdash;and
efforts all of which are in the right direction. It must
be remembered that in the education of her youth she
has to face difficulties which are altogether unknown in
this as in other European countries. One of these difficulties
is the fact that Japanese literature is more or less
mixed up with Chinese literature, and, accordingly, it is
necessary for the Japanese to learn Chinese as well as
Japanese characters, and also to study the Chinese classics.
Another difficulty is the one I touched on in my remarks
on the Japanese language, viz., the difference between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
written and spoken languages of Japan. In old times
the written and spoken languages were no doubt identical,
but Chinese literature influenced the country to so great
an extent that the written language in time became more
and more Chinese, while the spoken dialect remained
Japanese. The consequence is that the written language
is more or less a hotch-potch of Chinese characters
and the Japanese alphabet. Whether it will be possible
to overcome these obvious difficulties remains to be seen.
Several remedies have been proposed but none has so far
been adopted. One remedy was the use of the Japanese
alphabet alone for the written language, another the
introduction and adoption of the European alphabet.
Manifestly the difficulty of effecting such a change as the
adoption of either of these plans would involve would be
enormous. Still the retention of the present complicated
system is without doubt the great obstacle in the way of
educational progress in Japan, and it speaks eloquently
for the patience and pertinacity of the youth of that
country that they have effected so much in so short a
time in view of the difficulties that have had to be
encountered.</p>

<p>The strong points of the youth of Japan in the matter
of education are, in my opinion, their great powers of
concentration and their indomitable application to study
and perseverance in whatever they undertake. Of their
powers of absorption of any subject there can be no
question. It has been urged, as against this, that the
Japanese possess the defect not uncommon among people
of any race, viz., that the capacity for rapidly assimilating
knowledge is to some extent counteracted or rendered
abortive by an incapacity to practically apply that knowledge.
I may say for myself that though I have often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
heard this objection urged I have not seen any indications
of this lack of ability to practically apply knowledge on
the part of the Japanese. I should have thought that the
Russo-Japanese war would have afforded ample demonstration
of the ability of the Japanese to put to good
account the knowledge they had acquired and assimilated
in their seminaries.</p>

<p>I certainly think that the system of education, as it
exists in Japan to-day, is one not only admirably adapted
for the people of that country, but one from which some
Western nations might learn a few things. Japan has, in
her education system, settled the religious question simply
by ignoring it. Her morality as inculcated in every school
in the country, is a purely secular morality. I know that
there are some persons who will deem secular morality a
contradiction in terms. Indeed there are many eminent
Japanese who do not approve of the present system.
Count Okuma, for example, one of the ablest men in the
country, bewails the lack of a moral standard. The
upper classes have, he remarks, Chinese philosophy, the
great mass of the people have nothing. In the Western
world, he points out, Christianity supplies the moral
standard, while in Japan some desire to return to old
forms, others prefer Christianity; some lean on Kant,
others on other philosophers. Christianity may supply
the moral standard in the Western world, as Count
Okuma asserts, but if he has studied recent politics in
a particular part of the Western world, he must have seen
that Christianity in that part is by no means in accord as
to the teaching of religion in its schools, or what moral
code, if any, should be substituted for dogmatic instruction.
Perhaps, after all, Japan has not decided amiss in for the
present at any rate deciding that secular morality shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be the only ethical instruction given in her schools. That
code which she teaches, so far as I have had an opportunity
of studying it, is one which contains nothing that
could be in the slightest degree objected to by the votaries
of any religious system either in the East or in the West.</p>

<p class="caption">AMATEUR CONCHOLOGISTS<br />

<small>FROM A PRINT BY HIROSHIGE</small></p>

<p>Although it has no direct connection with morality,
secular or otherwise, it may be of interest if I give here a
synopsis of the teaching given in Japanese schools in
reference to the behaviour of the pupils towards foreigners.
These rules have been collected by an English newspaper
in Japan, and they certainly serve to show that the youth
of Japan are in this matter receiving instruction which,
whether regarded from an ethical standpoint or merely
that of good manners, cannot be too highly commended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never call after foreigners passing along the streets or
roads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When foreigners make inquiries, answer them politely.
If unable to make them understand, inform the police of
the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never accept a present from a foreigner when there is
no reason for his giving it, and never charge him anything
above what is proper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not crowd around a shop when a foreigner is making
purchases, thereby causing him much annoyance. The
continuance of this practice disgraces us as a nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since all human beings are brothers and sisters, there
is no reason for fearing foreigners. Treat them as equals
and act uprightly in all your dealings with them. Be
neither servile nor arrogant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware of combining against the foreigner and disliking
him because he is a foreigner; men are to be judged
by their conduct and not by their nationality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As intercourse with foreigners becomes closer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
extends over a series of years, there is danger that many
Japanese may become enamoured of their ways and customs
and forsake the good old customs of their forefathers.
Against this danger you must be on your guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking off your hat is the proper way to salute a
foreigner. The bending of the body low is not to be
commended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you see a foreigner be sure and cover up naked
parts of the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold in high regard the worship of ancestors and treat
your relations with warm cordiality, but do not regard a
person as your enemy because he or she is a Christian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In going through the world you will often find a knowledge
of a foreign tongue absolutely essential.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware of selling your souls to foreigners and becoming
their slaves. Sell them no houses or lands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aim at not being beaten in your competition with
foreigners. Remember that loyalty and filial piety are our
most precious national treasures and do nothing to violate
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems to me a pity that education on somewhat
similar lines to that embodied in these interesting rules
cannot be imparted to the youth of this and other
European countries. It would certainly tend, I think, in
the direction of good manners which are, I fear, sadly lacking
in many of the pupils who have undergone a course of
School Board instruction in England.</p>

<p>A question that may arise in regard to the details of
Japanese education is how far and in what degree do the
pertinacity and zeal of the youth of Japan for knowledge
affect their physique. We know that <i>mens sana in corpore
sano</i> is the ideal at which every one concerned with the
education of young people of both sexes ought to strive.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
There is no doubt whatever that too close an attention to
study of any kind, too constant an exercise of the mental
faculties, unless it is accompanied by a corresponding
exercise of the body, very often has an injurious effect
upon the human frame. Count Okuma, in referring to this
matter, has pointed out that the great difficulty of the
difference between the written and spoken languages is a
very serious tax upon the pupils in all the schools,
necessitating, as it does, the duplicating of their work. So
much time, he considers, has to be spent by them in study
on account of this duplicating that it is quite impossible
for students to have sufficient physical exercise, while if it
were decided to devote more time to exercise, the years
allotted to education would have to be lengthened&mdash;a fact
which must involve a serious loss in regard to the work of
the nation. I do not take quite such a pessimistic view
of the lack of physical education of the youth of Japan. In
the first place, gymnastics form part, an important part,
of the course of instruction in all schools throughout the
country, and in the next place the young people of Japan,
so far as I have been able to arrive at an opinion in the
matter, are almost if not quite as enthusiastic in regard to
various forms of outdoor sport as are those of this country.
The buoyancy and enthusiasm of youth are, indeed, very
much the same all over the world. It is only when youth
comes to what are very often erroneously described as
years of discretion that artificiality begins to assert itself.
Base-ball, lawn-tennis, bicycling, and rowing are all extensively
patronised by the young men of Japan, and cricket
has of recent years come considerably into vogue. The
students of the Imperial University have not only shown
no disinclination, but, on the contrary, an avidity to combine
athletics with their studies, and in base-ball especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they have more than held their own against the
foreigner. I confess I have no desire to see the craze for
outdoor sports which is so much in evidence in this
country extending to Japan. Some of the public schools
in England are much more famous for their cricket, football,
and other teams than for the education imparted in
them. Many a young man leaves those schools an
excellent cricketer or football player, but, from an educational
point of view, very badly equipped for the battle of
life. The happy mean is surely the best in this as in other
matters, and I venture to think that the youth of Japan in
regarding education as the essential matter and outdoor
sport as merely a subsidiary one have shown sound
judgment.</p>

<p>In my remarks on education in Japan I have dealt
principally with the schools for boys. I may, however,
remark that in the arrangements she has made for the
education of the other sex she has shown the same
thoroughness. In the primary schools the boys and girls
are taken in without any distinction, though separate
classes are usually formed. There are subsequently higher
schools for girls. The percentage of the female sex attending
these schools is less than that of the other. There are
in all about seventy-five of these schools in Japan with
some twenty thousand pupils. The course of instruction
in them is moral precepts, Japanese language, a foreign
language, history, geography, mathematics, science, drawing,
training for domestic affairs, cutting-out and sewing,
music and gymnastics. I think in regard to these schools
the Japanese authorities have shown sound judgment in
decreeing that music shall not necessarily form part of the
education of every young girl, but may be omitted for
those pupils for whom the art may be deemed difficult.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Were a similar rule to be adopted in this country quite a
number of people would be saved a large amount of
unnecessary torture. There is also a higher normal school
for women at Tokio, as likewise an Academy of Music.
The Tokio Jiogakkwan is an institution established by
some foreign philanthropists for the purpose of educating
Japanese girls of a respectable class in Anglo-Saxon
attainments. This institution has between two and three
hundred pupils, but I am not in a position to state what
measure of success, if any, it has achieved, nor indeed do
I know what &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon attainments&rdquo; are supposed
to be. Many of them I should have thought were quite
unsuitable for the ordinary Japanese girl, tending, as they
must, to destroy her national individuality. There is also
a girls&rsquo; college in Tokio called the Women&rsquo;s University.
It does not confer degrees, but it gives a very high education,
and it is largely patronised.</p>

<p>I stated at the commencement of this chapter that I
was of opinion the provisions and arrangements a nation
had made for the education of its youth were an excellent
test of the standard to which its civilisation has attained.
I hope the slight sketch I have given my readers of the
system of education in existence in Japan will enable them
to form an estimate as to the place Japan should occupy
if judged by the standard referred to. In my opinion,
seeing that it is less than forty years since the country
passed through a drastic revolution&mdash;a revolution which
destroyed all these social forces which had been in existence
and had exercised a tremendous influence on the life
of the people for many centuries&mdash;it is, I think, not only
extraordinary but highly creditable to her rulers that
Japan should have in that short interval organised and
perfected such a system of education as exists in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
country to-day. Under that system every boy and girl
in the land receives an admirable course of instruction, and
is afforded facilities for still further extending and enlarging
that course, and, if his or her abilities, ambitions, and
opportunities incline them that way, to proceed steadily
onward in the acquisition of knowledge, until they obtain
as a coping stone, that final course, in the capital either at
the Imperial University or the Women&rsquo;s University where
the sum of all the knowledge of the world is at the disposal
of those who have the capacity and the aspiration to
acquire it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE JAPANESE ARMY AND NAVY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> WORK on Japan which did not include some
reference to the Army and Navy would manifestly
be incomplete. It is hardly any exaggeration to assert
that nothing in regard to the metamorphosis of Japan has
so impressed the Western mind as the extraordinary
progress of its naval and military forces. Both in this
country and on the Continent it was, of course, known that
Japan had been for years evolving both an Army and
Navy, but I imagine most persons thought that this action
on her part was merely a piece of childish extravagance, and
that her land and sea forces would, if they were ever pitted
against Europeans, prove as impotent as Orientals nearly
always have proved. I am quite aware that naval and
military experts of various nationalities who had studied
matters on the spot were of a different opinion. They
witnessed the high state of efficiency of both the Japanese
Army and Navy, the patriotic spirit of the officers and
men, their enthusiasm for their work, and that universal
feeling of bravery, if it be bravery, which consists in an
absolute contempt of life. Still I think, even to the
experts, the splendid organisation and overwhelming
superiority of Japan in her encounter with China came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
as somewhat of a surprise. The complete victory of the
Island Nation in that struggle was, I know, to a certain
extent discounted in some quarters by the stories that
were published as to the wretched condition of both the
Chinese Army and Navy, their utter unfitness and unpreparedness
for war, the incompetence and corruption of
the officers, and so on. There were many otherwise well
informed persons who felt confident that though Japan had
experienced little or no difficulty in mastering China, the
case would be different when, if ever, she was involved in
war with a European power. I do not think these doubts
were prevalent or indeed present at all, in the minds of
the naval and military authorities. No responsible statesman
or official in Japan desired war. The Japanese are
not in any sense a bellicose people. Still, the statesmen
of the country were fully alive to the fact that it might be
necessary to fight for the national existence. They had
had experience in the past of the ambition of Russia to
aggrandise herself at the expense of Japan. They saw,
or thought they saw, that Russia had designs on Korea,
and they were determined to frustrate those designs, and
so perhaps obviate in the best manner possible future
attempts on the independence of Japan itself. And hence
it came about that serious efforts were directed to create
an Army and Navy strong and efficient.</p>

<p>The creation, or perhaps it would be more correct to say
the reorganisation, of the Army was entrusted, soon after
the Revolution of 1868, to a few European officers, and
it has proceeded throughout on European lines. The task
was not so difficult as might have been expected. In
old Japan the terms &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; and &ldquo;Samurai&rdquo; were
synonymous, and the security of the territory of each
of the great feudal princes depended on the strength
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of his army. The Continental system of conscription
was adopted and still obtains. All Japanese males
between the ages of 17 and 40 are liable to military
service. The Service is divided into Active, Landwehr,
Dep&ocirc;t, and Landsturn services. The Active service is
divided into service with the colours and service with
the first reserve. The former is obligatory for all who
have reached the full age of 20 years, and such service
is for a period of three years. Service in the first reserve
is compulsory for all who have finished service
with the colours, and lasts for a period of four years and
four months. The Landwehr reserve is comprised of
those who have finished the first reserve term, and it
continues for a period of five years. The Dep&ocirc;t service
is divided into two sections. The first, which lasts seven
years and four months, is made up of those who have
not been enlisted for Active service, while the second,
extending over one year and four months, consists of
those who have not been enlisted for first Dep&ocirc;t service.
The Landsturn is in two divisions&mdash;one for those who
have completed the term of Landwehr service and the
first Dep&ocirc;t service, and the second for all who are not
on the other services. This system of conscription, of
course, lends itself to criticism, and it has been criticised
by the military experts of great military nations, but
on the whole it has been proved by the experience of
the two wars in which Japan has been involved during
the last twelve years to have worked well, and it probably
answers as well as any system that could be devised,
the needs of the country, and the characteristics
of the people thereof. The Japanese are, as these
recent wars amply demonstrated, patriotic to a degree.
They not only have great powers of perseverance, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
great capacities for assimilation and adaptation, and are
considered by many military authorities probably the very
best raw material in the world out of which to make
soldiers. Conscription may not be an ideal system for any
country. It is, of course, better from one point of view
that the armed forces of a nation should voluntarily enlist
rather than be pressed men. But conscription in Japan
has never been, and is not likely to be, such a burden as is
the case among some European nations. The Japanese
idea of patriotism is something totally different to that
which obtains in the West. The late war afforded ample
evidence of that, were any needed.</p>

<p>The war with Russia has been so recently concluded
that it is not necessary to enter at any length into a consideration
of the Japanese Army. The history of that
war gave ocular demonstration to the European nations,
however incredulous they may previously have been on the
subject, that Japan was in fact a great military Power.
In the course of that war she put in the field somewhere
about 700,000 men, conveyed them across the sea to a
foreign country, and showed throughout the struggle a
capacity for the most wonderful military organisation.
The smallest details were most carefully attended to; there
was an entire absence of that muddle so much in evidence
when European nations are engaged in hostilities. Respecting
the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier it is
hardly necessary to say anything. On the field of battle
or during the long, arduous and monotonous work of a
siege he has shown himself alike a model soldier. Perhaps
he has shone most in the hour of victory by his moderation.
Every foreign officer who saw the work done by the
Japanese Army throughout the various incidents of the
Russian War was lost in admiration. To me the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
pleasing feature of that war was the ease with which the
soldier, on coming back to Japan, returned to the peaceful
pursuits of civil life. The bumptious braggadocio that
European military nations have developed has no counterpart
in Japan. The war was, in the estimation of the
people, a sacred duty. The burdens which it entailed were
cheerfully borne. The Japanese soldier bore his hardships
or gave up his life equally cheerfully. At the same time
the conclusion of the war came as a relief, and the mass of
the soldiery gladly went through the Japanese equivalent
of turning their swords into ploughshares. Japan has
demonstrated that she is a great military nation, and the
organisation of her Army is one that might well be studied
by the military authorities of other countries.</p>

<p>The weak point of the Japanese Army is its cavalry.
Whether cavalry in the warfare of the future will play the
important part that it has played in that of the past is a
matter upon which I do not care to dogmatically pronounce,
especially as military authorities are by no means
in agreement in regard thereto, or indeed as to the precise
functions of cavalry in military warfare. The difficulties
of Japan in regard to organising an efficient cavalry have
been largely, if not altogether, owing to the lack of good
horses in the country. The Japanese horses have not been
conspicuous for quality, while the number available has
not been anything like sufficient to enable the cavalry to
be brought up to a proper condition of strength and
efficiency. The Japanese military authorities have long
been sensible of this fact, and the late war amply demonstrated
it. With its usual thoroughness, the Government
has, as soon as possible after the close of the war, taken
steps to remedy this weak point in its military system, and
quite recently two delegates of the Ministry of Agriculture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
have been despatched to Europe on a horse-purchase
mission. Ten million yen have, I understand, been
apportioned for the purpose of improving the national
breed of horses, and the delegates have been instructed to
purchase suitable animals for breeding. The Japanese
Government has almost invariably been successful in anything
it has undertaken, and I venture to predict&mdash;it is
scarcely a hazardous prophesy&mdash;that the horse supply of
the country will ere long be put on a satisfactory footing
and the cavalry be rendered as efficient as every other
branch of the Japanese Army.</p>

<p>There is no fear of a military autocracy in Japan. The
recent war proved not only the bravery of the rank and
file of the Army, but the high military talent of the officers.
The art of war had evidently been studied from every
point of view, and was diligently applied. The Japanese
talent, in my opinion, consists not in a mere mechanical
copying, but in a practical adaptation of all that is best in
Western civilisation. The tactics and strategy displayed
during the war with Russia showed originality in conception,
brilliancy and daring. If that war did not
discover a Napoleon among the Japanese generals, it
can at least be said that Japan has no need of a
Napoleon. As I have said, there is no fear of the
development of a military autocracy in that country or
the uprising of a general with Napoleonic ideas and
ambition. The generals who justly earned distinction
during the recent war are singularly modest men, with
no capacity for self-advertising and no desire whatever
for self-aggrandisement. They are not only content but
anxious, now that the war is over, to sink into obscurity.
History will, however, not permit of that. Their achievements
in the recent campaign will long afford subject-matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for study and the instruction of the military
students of the future. In this book I have as far as
possible avoided mentioning names, otherwise I would
gladly inscribe on its pages the names of those many
generals who earned fame in the Russo-Japanese War.
I feel perfectly certain that every endeavour will be made
to maintain the Japanese Army in the high state of
efficiency it has reached. At the same time I would
emphasise the fact that that Army is intended solely
for defence. Japan has, in a word, no military ambitions
outside her own territory.</p>

<p>And as of the Army, so of the Navy. Perhaps the
prowess of Japan&rsquo;s Fleet impressed the English people
even more than the victories of her soldiers. Because
the Navy, as it is to-day, is largely the outcome of
English training and the application of English ideas.
In the first instance Japan borrowed from the British
Government the services of some of its best naval officers
to develop the Japanese Navy. A naval college was
established in the capital, modelled on the English system
of training. A dockyard was also constructed at Yokosko
under French guidance. It is, however, a mistake to suppose
that Japan had no Navy or no ambitions in the
direction of creating one prior to English naval officers
being lent to the Japanese Government to assist in the
reorganisation of the Navy. The determination to create
a fleet on European lines was entertained by Japanese
statesmen as far back as the &rsquo;fifties, when the European
Powers and the United States of America were bringing
pressure to bear on Japan with a view of obtaining trading
facilities and the opening up of the country generally.
The Japanese statesmen of those days were wise enough
to see that unless Japan was to be permanently under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tutelage of the European Powers, it was necessary for her
to construct a fleet and army on European lines. Soon
afterwards a naval school, under Dutch instructors, was
established at Nagasaki, and a certain number of selected
officers and men were sent to Europe to undergo a course
of instruction, and several war-vessels were ordered from
Holland. In 1854 a two-masted ship was built in Japan
from an English model, and subsequently two others.
During the war between Russia and Great Britain a
Russian sloop was wrecked on the Japanese coast, and
permission was obtained for Japanese workmen to be
employed in the repairs of the vessel, with a view of
giving them an opportunity of gaining some practical
knowledge of naval architecture. In 1855 the King of
Holland presented a steam corvette to the Tycoon. In
this year the now familiar Japanese ensign&mdash;a red ball
on a white ground&mdash;was introduced, and has since remained
the national flag.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Lord Elgin in Japan on a mission in
1857 a sailing vessel at Nagasaki was flying the flag of an
Admiral of the Japanese Navy. In the same year a steam
yacht was presented to the Tycoon by the late Queen
Victoria, and was formally handed over to the Japanese
Government by Lord Elgin. His secretary relates that
the yacht got under way, commanded by a Japanese
captain and manned by Japanese sailors, while her
machinery was worked by Japanese engineers. The
secretary, in his account of the incident, relates that
&ldquo;notwithstanding the horizontal cylinders and other
latest improvements with which her engines were fitted,
the men had learnt their lesson well, and were confident
in their powers, and the yacht steamed gallantly through
and round the Fleet, returning to her anchorage without a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hitch.&rdquo; This authoritative statement ought to dispose of
the absurd story which has long been a chestnut among
the English community in Japan and the English naval
officers on the China station, that when the old Confederate
Ram, the <i>Stonewall Jackson</i>, was purchased in
America and brought to Yokohama a somewhat ludicrous
incident occurred. According to the story, which, I may
observe, is one of the <i>ben trovato</i> order, when steam was
got up in the vessel for trial purposes it had to steam
round and about Yokohama Harbour, to the great danger
of the foreign warships and merchant steamers there, until
the steam was in due course exhausted and the machinery
automatically stopped through the lack of any motive
power to drive it, as the Japanese engineer in charge did
not know how to shut off steam. The <i>Stonewall Jackson</i>,
I may observe, did not take part in the now almost forgotten
battle of Hakodate, which took place at the time
of the Revolution, and may be regarded as the expiring
effort of old Japan to stay the march of events in that
country. In the battle of Hakodate the rebel fleet was
totally destroyed, and the various clans in the country
who possessed war-vessels of one kind or other presented
them to the central Government. These vessels, it must
be confessed, were not of much, if any, utility in the direction
of forming a Navy, and I am not aware how many of
them, or indeed whether any of them, were utilised for the
purpose of inaugurating that Navy which has now become
world-famous.</p>

<p>In 1858 the naval school, which, as I have already
stated, had been established at Nagasaki, was transferred
to Yeddo, and a few years later the Japanese Government
determined to obtain the assistance of some English naval
officers with a view of giving instruction in the school.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Application was accordingly made to the British Government
through the Minister in Yeddo, and the sanction of
the Admiralty having been obtained, a number of English
naval officers were selected, and despatched to Japan as
instructors in the Yeddo Naval College. Amongst these
officers, it may be interesting to state, was Admiral Sir
A.&nbsp;K. Wilson, V.C., G.C.B., the late Commander-in-Chief
of the Channel Fleet. In the year 1873 a number of
other naval officers were sent out from England, the previous
staff having been withdrawn on the outbreak of the
Civil War. This staff was in charge of Admiral Sir
A.&nbsp;L. Douglas, till recently Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth,
and for some years subsequently an English naval
officer was at the head of the instructing staff of the
college. Japan was fortunate in one respect&mdash;in the
Englishmen she entrusted with the evolution of her Navy.
She was fortunate in attracting the men best fitted for the
work, and also in inspiring them with a high conception of
their task. Some Englishmen are of opinion that Japan
has somewhat forgotten her obligations in this matter.
Young Japan, they suggest, desires to forget the influences
to which the country mainly owes its present magnificent
fleet. That fleet is undoubtedly, for the most part, the
outcome of English conceptions and English training.
There is one man whose name, I think, deserves to be
recorded in connection therewith. I refer to the late
Lieutenant A.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;S. Hawes, of the Royal Marine Light
Infantry, who left the English Service and worked
strenuously, enthusiastically, and earnestly to build up
the <i>personnel</i> of the Japanese Navy in the early &rsquo;seventies.
There were others whose efforts in the same direction
assisted in that consummation, but Hawes&rsquo;s services were
unique and splendid. He believed in Japan, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
threw himself into his work with a zeal and ardour which
were beyond praise. His services were dispensed with, as
were those of the other English officers and men, when it
was felt that Japan had learnt sufficient to work out her
own destiny as a naval Power. The labours of these men
may not have been adequately recognised at the time, but
their work remains, and is in evidence to-day. Hawes
received a decoration from the Mikado, and the British
Government gave him a consular appointment in some
obscure quarter of the globe, where he died a disappointed
man, fully sensible of the value of the work he had performed
and inspired, a firm believer in the future of
Japan as a great naval Power, but disgusted with the
non-recognition of his labours.</p>

<p>The Navy of Japan as it is to-day is a triumph of
organisation. Discussing a short time ago the question
with an ex-officer of the Mercantile Marine who had, by
a curious chance, served as a Naval Reserve officer in
both the English and Japanese Navies, he explained to
me the wonderful progress of the latter by pointing out
that it had been, as it were, called instantaneously into
existence. The Japanese Navy, he observed, had no past
and no traditions to hamper its development; its officers
and administrators had only one desire&mdash;to get the best of
everything in modern naval science from anywhere. There
was no cult of seamanship, no dead wall of prejudice to
trammel modern naval developments. There was no prejudice
at the Japanese Admiralty against anything&mdash;save
stagnation. Progress was the keynote and watchword of
the Japanese Navy. My friend assured me that it was, as
regards equipment, organisation, and general efficiency, the
finest fighting force the world has ever seen. So far as my
own knowledge of the matter goes, and so far as I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
competent to express an opinion on the subject, I fully
endorse these observations. A visit to a Japanese vessel-of-war,
however perfunctory the knowledge of the visitor
may be on matters naval, very soon convinces him of
the fact that the Japanese naval officers and men are filled
not only with ardour but enthusiasm for their profession,
that efficiency and proficiency are the watchwords, and
that the desire of every one connected with the Navy,
from the Admiral downwards, is to maintain the <i>personnel</i>
and <i>materiel</i> of the Fleet in the highest possible condition
of efficiency.</p>

<p>If, as some Englishmen imagine is the case, there is
a tendency on the part of young Japan to be oblivious
of the fact that the Navy of the country is greatly
indebted for its present state of efficiency to the zeal
and efforts of English naval officers in its early days,
there is no question that the feeling of the officers and
men of the Japanese Navy to their English comrades is
of a very hearty nature. The formal alliance with Great
Britain was highly popular in the Japanese Fleet, and I
have never heard any officer connected therewith speak
in any but the highest and most cordial terms of their
English <i>confr&eacute;res</i>.</p>

<p>It is not, I think, necessary for me to refer to the deeds
of and the work done by the Japanese Navy in the course
of the war with Russia; very much the same remarks that
I have made in regard to the Army apply here. Nothing
was lost sight of or omitted that could in the slightest
degree tend to ensure or secure success. Everything
seems to have been foreseen. Nothing was left to chance.
The results were precisely what might have been expected,
and what indeed were expected, by those who had
an intimate knowledge of the manner in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Japanese Navy was organised for war. I regard it
especially in alliance with the English Fleet, as one of
the greatest safeguards for the peace of the world. I
trust the alliance between this country and Japan may
be of a permanent nature. I may remark in respect
of the Fleet, as I have of the Army, that Japan has
no unworthy ambitions. Her desire is to conserve what
she possesses and to render her Island Empire secure
from invasion or molestation.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the development of Japan&rsquo;s
Navy is that of her Mercantile Marine. A few words
in regard to it may therefore not be out of place here.
The insular position and the mountainous condition of
the country, as well as its extent of seaboard, early
impressed on the makers of new Japan the necessity for
creating not only a great mercantile fleet but also for developing
the shipbuilding industry. Both these ambitions
have been largely realised. At first their consummation
was attended with many difficulties. The Japanese, as I
have already remarked in this book, were many centuries
ago enterprising sailors, but when the country was closed
voyages of discovery or trade automatically came to an
end. With the awakening of Japan a change immediately
took place, and steps were taken to create and
develop the Mercantile Marine. A Japanese gentleman,
Mr. Iwasaki, in 1872 started a line of steamers, subsidised
by the Government, the well-known Mitsu Bishi Company.
Shortly afterwards another company was formed
to compete against it. This line was also subsidised
by the Government, but as the rivalry did not prove
profitable to either the two lines were amalgamated in
1885 under the title of Nippon Yusen Kaisha. Since then
a number of other shipping companies have been formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in Japan, and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha has largely
extended its operations, opening up communication with
Bombay, England, and the Continent, Melbourne, &amp;c. In
fact, the Japanese flag is now seen in many parts of the
world, while the Japanese Mercantile Marine has advanced
by leaps and bounds, and is still annually increasing. At
the end of 1904 there were about 240 steamers flying the
Japanese flag, with a gross tonnage of over 790,000.
Japan now ranks high among the maritime nations of
the world, and her position therein, unless I am very
much mistaken, will still further advance in the years
to come.</p>

<p>There are, I know, a great number of worthy people,
both in this country and Japan, who regard the expenditure
on an Army and Navy as entirely unproductive, and
look forward to the halcyon days when all such expenditure
shall cease and the taxation now devoted to these
purposes shall be diverted to more worthy objects. I am
afraid, as the world is at present constituted, there is no
prospect of such a, in some respects, desirable consummation
being effected. Nowadays the most effective means
a nation can possess in the direction of the maintenance
and enjoyment of peace is to be well prepared for war.
That is a fact of which I am sure the men responsible
for the government of Japan are firmly convinced; and
I believe they are right. I am certain, as I have said
before, that the world has nothing to fear from the
armed strength of Japan by land or sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>JAPANESE ART&mdash;INTRODUCTORY&mdash;LACQUER WARE,
POTTERY AND PORCELAIN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>APANESE art is a subject which invites exhaustive
treatment. To deal with it adequately in two or three
chapters of a general work on Japan is obviously
impossible. Still it is, I think, possible, within the limits
at my disposal, to give my readers some conception of
that art to which Japan is so greatly indebted for the
extraordinary way in which she has impressed the world.
The art of Japan is in a sense unique, and it may be
that to some extent the Japanese atmosphere, so to
speak, is essential in order to fully appreciate it. Mr.
Chamberlain, in his &ldquo;Things Japanese,&rdquo; has observed that
&ldquo;To show a really fine piece of lacquer to one of the
uncultivated natives of Europe or America is, as the
Japanese proverb says, like giving guineas to a cat.&rdquo;
Much the same remark might, however, be made in
reference to the art products of any country. Be that
as it may, the Japanese people are now largely dependent
on the foreigner for art patronage. It may be that this
has resulted in art-artisans abandoning their old standard
and devoting themselves to the manufacture of whatever
pays best, prostituting the spirit of art to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
promptings of gain, and compelling the native to cater for
foreign taste rather than to adhere to Japanese canons of
art. I am afraid that the commercial spirit is fatal to art
of any kind. The true artist, like the poet, in an ideal
state of existence would only work under inspiration, but,
unfortunately, the artist, like the poet, is daily faced by
that necessity which knows no law and demands the
subsistence of the body as an essential for work of
any kind.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers might desire a definition of
art. There are, I know, people in this world who can
never approach the consideration of or deal with any
subject unless the subject itself and every term in connection
therewith is precisely defined. In reference to
Japanese art I am inclined to employ the words of Mr.
Walter Crane in opening, many years ago, the annual
exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society. He remarked:
&ldquo;The true root and basis of all art lies in the handicrafts.
If there is no room or chance of recognition for really
artistic power and feeling in design and craftsmanship&mdash;if
art is not recognised in the humblest object and
material, and felt to be as valuable, in its own way, as
the more highly rewarded pictorial skill&mdash;the art cannot
be in a sound condition. And if artists cease to be
found among the crafts, there is great danger that they
will vanish from the arts also, and become manufacturers
and salesmen instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japanese art is unquestionably of that kind which
requires a certain educational process. It does not, for
instance, at once appeal to that vague entity the &ldquo;man
in the street.&rdquo; There is a grotesqueness about some of
it, a lack of perspective in much of it, which is caviare
to a large number of persons. This much, however, can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
be said about Japanese art&mdash;that it is original. It is almost
altogether the outcome of the artistic instincts of the
people. Undoubtedly it has been to a large extent influenced
by Buddhism, and, as we have seen, Buddhism
is a foreign religion; but at the same time I think it
may fairly be asserted that, though the Buddhist religion
may have influenced and utilised Japanese art, it has never
killed, or indeed affected to any degree, what I may term
the individualistic artistic instincts of the nation. Japanese
art requires to be closely studied. It is something that
grows upon one, and the closer it is studied the greater its
influence. To me one of its most pleasing features is what
I have termed in the Preface its catholicity. It is not, as
art is in so many European countries, the cult of a few, a
sort of Eleusynian mystery into which a select number
of persons have been initiated. It has, on the contrary,
permeated, and exercised an influence upon, the whole
nation, and been employed for even the most humble
purposes. It is for this reason that, as I have previously
observed, I am of opinion the Japanese may be considered
and described as the most artistic people in the world.</p>

<p>I have referred to the grotesqueness and lack of perspective
incidental to some descriptions of Japanese art. It
certainly neglects chiaroscuro and linear perspective, and
it displays an entire lack of form knowledge. The human
figure and face have apparently never been studied at all.
The colouring is frequently splendid, while the figures are
for the most part anatomically incorrect. One would
think that Japanese artists had never seen their own or
any other human bodies. A rigid adherence to conventionality
is, in my opinion, a defect of all Japanese
art. By conventionality I do not, of course, mean what I
may term the individuality of the art itself, but the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that Japanese artists have felt themselves largely bound by
the traditions of their art to treat the human and other
figures not in accordance with nature, but altogether in
accordance with the conventions of that art, and to
entirely ignore perspective. I am quite aware that some
enthusiastic lovers of things Japanese admire, or affect
to admire, these defects. They have been described as
a protest against the too rigid rules exacted in Western
art. I suggest, however, that art in its highest form
should seek to be true to nature, and in so far as Japanese
art fails in this respect it is, I think, defective. At the
same time I cordially admit that its defects are more
than compensated by its splendid workmanship, its
gorgeous colouring, and its striking originality.</p>

<p>It was only about forty or fifty years ago that Japanese
art became known to any extent in Europe. Certainly
the Portuguese missionaries introduced by Francis Xavier
and the traders in the Dutch factory at Nagasaki were
in the habit of exporting a few articles to Europe, chiefly
porcelain ware made to order. I fear both missionaries
and merchants regarded Japanese art, as we now
know it, as barbaric, and never in the slightest degree
realised either its beauties or its originality. Neither
they nor the many millions of art-lovers in Europe
dreamt that Japan was a country where art was universal,
not esoteric&mdash;an art with schools, traditions, masters, and
masterpieces. Probably the Paris Exhibition of 1867,
to which the Prince of Satsuma sent a collection of
Japanese artistic treasures, was the occasion when the
true inwardness of Japanese art burst upon the Western
world as a whole. It was a veritable revelation. It
at once aroused enthusiasm and curiosity, and I fear
cupidity, among European artists and art collectors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Europe was awakened to the possibilities of Japan as
an art nation, and Japan, failing to realise or properly
appreciate the artistic accumulated wealth it possessed,
commenced to part with it in a truly reckless manner.
The depletion of the art treasures of the country commenced
about this time, and though that depletion has
been largely arrested, it is nevertheless still, to some
extent, going on.</p>

<p>Japanese art, as it has come under the cognisance of
a foreigner, may be considered in connection with four
or five purposes to which it has been employed or adapted.
First amongst these I place lacquer, next pottery and
porcelain, then carving in wood and iron, metal-work and
painting. The lacquer industry has been in existence
in Japan so long as we have any authoritative history
of the country. If any credence is to be given to tradition,
long before the Christian era there was an official whose
sole duty it was to superintend the production of lacquer
for the Imperial Court, and specimens over a thousand
years old, though rare, still exist. The process of lacquering
is a somewhat intricate one, and varies, of course,
in accordance with the time and labour spent on the
article to be lacquered, and the cost of the same. After
the article has been carefully made from specially selected
wood&mdash;in the case of the choicest specimens of lacquer
work this is usually a pine-wood of fine grain&mdash;it is first
coated with a preparation composed of clay and varnish,
which, after being permitted to dry, is smoothed down
with a whetstone. When this operation has been concluded,
the article proposed to be lacquered is covered
with some substance, either silk, cloth, or paper. It is
then given from one to five coats of the foregoing mixture,
each coat being permitted to dry before the next is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
applied. After this has been effected, the whetstone
is again employed with a view of obtaining a perfectly
smooth surface when the lacquering proper commences.
This may be a perfunctory or it may be a very complicated
operation, according to the value of the article,
layer after layer of the varnish&mdash;from one to fifty coats&mdash;being
laid upon the material at intervals. After the final
coat has been applied, the smoothing process commences.
The whole of these operations are, however, only the
preliminaries to the scheme of decoration, which is often
very elaborate. The dusts of powders used for this
purpose are of various kinds and of varying cost. When
the ornamentation which often consists in colouring the
groundwork with particles of gold dust has been completed,
sometimes as many as a dozen coatings of transparent
lacquer are imposed upon the same.</p>

<p>The art of lacquering in Japan dates back at least
1,200 or 1,300 years, and tradition assigns it a period more
ancient still. There are, however, few if any articles
of lacquer ware now in the country, whose origin can
be traced back so many years. At any rate, there is
no satisfactory evidence in regard to the antiquity of
any specimens of lacquer ware dating back more than
seven or eight centuries. In old Japan the manufacturer
of lacquer work was intimately associated with the
domestic life of the upper classes. Griffis tells us that
nearly every Daimio had his Court lacquerer, and that
a set of household furniture and toilet utensils was part
of the dowry of a noble lady. On the birth of a daughter,
he relates, it was common for the lacquer artist to begin
the making of a mirror case, a washing bowl, a cabinet,
a clothes rack, or a chest of drawers, often occupying from
one to five whole years on a single article. An inro, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
pill-box, might require several years for perfection, though
small enough to go into a fob. By the time the young
lady was marriageable, her outfit of lacquer was superb.</p>

<p>The names of many of the great lacquer artists of
Japan are still venerated. The masterpieces of Hoyami
Koyetsu who flourished in the sixteenth century, are
still, though rare, procurable. Japan numbers on her roll
of fame twenty-eight great lacquer artists. There have,
of course, been many hundreds, and indeed thousands,
in the past centuries whose work was superb, but the
twenty-eight are deemed to be the immortals of this
particular art. One of these great men, Ogawa Ritsuo,
is famous for the number and variety of the materials&mdash;mother-of-pearl,
coral, tortoise-shell, &amp;c. &amp;c., he used in
his work. A profuse richness is its chief characteristic.
One of his pupils imitated in his work various materials&mdash;pottery
and wood-carving, and bronzes. The last famous
artist in lacquer, Watanobe Tosu, died about thirty years
ago. Whether he is destined to have a successor or
successors remains to be seen. These lacquer artists,
as I have indicated, worked not for lucre, but for love.
Attached to some Daimios household, they devoted their
lives, their energies, their imagination, their artistic instincts
to the devising of splendid work and the making
of beautiful, ingenious, absolutely artistic and, at the
same time, entirely useful articles.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the space at my disposal to deal
in detail with the large variety of lacquer work produced
in Japan with the various kinds of lacquer, or with what
I may term the artistic idiosyncrasies of Japanese lacquer
work. One can now hardly believe that until the opening up
of Japan half a century or so ago, few specimens of lacquer
found their way to Europe, although Japanese porcelain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had been largely imported and was highly prized. Even
at the present time I do not think that the artistic beauties
of Japanese lacquer work have been appreciated in this
country to anything like the extent they deserve to be.
I have heard people remark, for example, that they failed
to understand the perpetual reproduction of the great
snow-covered mountain Fusi-Yama in Japanese designs,
while they could see nothing in these storks, bewildering
landscapes, and grotesque figures. Perhaps the best explanation
of the constant appearance of Fusi-Yama in
all Japanese work is that which De Fonblanque gives.
He says: &ldquo;If there is one sentiment universal amongst
all Japanese, it is a deep and earnest reverence for their
sacred mountain. It is their ideal of the beautiful in
nature, and they never tire of admiring, glorifying, and
reproducing it. It is painted, embossed, carved, engraved,
modelled in all their wares. The mass of the people
regard it not only as the shrine of their dearest gods,
but the certain panacea for their worst evils, from impending
bankruptcy or cutaneous diseases to unrequited
love or ill-luck at play. It is annually visited by thousands
and thousands of pilgrims.&rdquo; The Japanese artist in constantly
reproducing Fusi-Yama has merely voiced national
sentiment and feeling.</p>

<p class="caption">VIEW OF FUSI-YAMA FROM A TEA HOUSE<br />

<p>The substance applied to wood to produce what is called
lacquer, is not what is generally known in England as
varnish. It is really the sap of the <i>rhus vernicifera</i>
which contains, among other ingredients, about 3 per
cent. of a gum soluble in water. It has to undergo various
refining processes before being mixed with the colouring
matter, while the greatest care is exercised throughout
with a view of obviating the possibility of dust or any
other foreign matter finding its way into the mixture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The fine polish usually seen on lacquer work is not
actually the result of the composition applied, but is
produced by incessant polishing. The lacquered articles
in old Japan were used for various purposes&mdash;mirror cases,
fans, letter-carriers, the inro, which was at one time a
necessary part of every Japanese gentleman&rsquo;s attire; it
was secured to the sash, and utilised to hold medicine
powders, for perfumes, as a seal-box, &amp;c., seals being at
one time, as indeed they are to some extent still, in use in
place of a signature. But the amount of ancient lacquer
ware now in Japan, or, indeed, of artistic articles made
solely for use and not merely to sell, is, as I have said,
small. European collectors have denuded the country;
the treasures of the Daimios, which were almost recklessly
sold when they were disestablished, and to a large extent
disendowed, have been distributed all over the globe, and
a large quantity, perhaps the largest quantity, of the
lacquer work now made in the country is manufactured
solely for the purpose of being sold as curios either at
home or abroad. That this fact has largely lowered the
artistic ideals and debased the artistic taste in Japan
appears to be the general opinion. Much of the present-day
work of Japan in lacquer, as in other articles, is
certainly to my mind artistic and beautiful in the extreme,
but obviously, men working almost against time to turn
out &ldquo;curios,&rdquo; for which there is a persistent demand on
the part of visitors who are not always by temperament
or training fitted to appreciate the artistic or the beautiful,
are unlikely to produce such fine or original work as the
artisan of old leisurely employed at his craft and pluming
himself, not on the amount of his earnings or the extent
of his output, but on the quality and artistic merits of
his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Next to lacquer in importance amongst the Japanese
arts, I think, comes ceramic ware, which has long had a
great vogue in Europe, and indeed was highly prized here
many years before the artistic skill of the Japanese in
lacquer was generally known. That decorative art, as
expressed in the pottery and porcelain of Japan, has been
largely influenced by China and Korea seems to be unquestionable.
The Japanese have nevertheless imparted
to it a peculiar charm of their own, the outcome of
originality in ideas, while the art has, through many
centuries, been fortunate enough to have been fostered and
encouraged by the great and powerful of the land. As a
people the Japanese are entirely free from anything that
savours of ostentation, and this fact is emphasised in their
art just as it is in their homes. The charm of the ceramic
ware of Japan, in my opinion, consists in the beauty of
its colouring rather than in its figuring. This ceramic
ware, as my readers probably know, differs greatly in
appearance, quality, and, I may add, in price according to
the particular part of the country in which it is produced.
It is not necessary to be an art connoisseur to grasp the
fact that, say, the famous Satsuma ware is distinct in
almost every respect from that of Imari, Kaga, Ise, Raku,
Kyoto, &amp;c. All these different wares have charms
peculiar to each. It is really marvellous to think that a
country with such a comparatively small area as Japan
should have produced so many different kinds of ceramic
ware, each possessing distinct and pronounced characteristics,
and having indeed little affinity with each other save
in regard to the general excellence of the workmanship
and the artistic completeness of the whole.</p>

<p>As I have said, both Korea and China have had a
marked influence on the manufacture of pottery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
porcelain in Japan. Korean potters appear to have
settled there prior to the Christian era, and to have
imparted to the Japanese the first rudiments of knowledge
in regard to working in clay, but the development of the
process was greatly due to Chinese influences. During the
thirteenth century, one Toshiro paid a visit to China,
where he exhaustively studied everything relating to the
potter&rsquo;s art. On his return to his own country he introduced
great improvements, both in manufacture and
decoration, and made, it is believed, for the first time,
glazed pottery. Soon afterwards household utensils of
lacquer began to go out of use, being replaced by those
made of clay, and a great impetus was accordingly given
to the trade of the potter. Tea, which is believed to have
been introduced into Japan from China in the year 800
does not appear to have come into general use till the
sixteenth century. The &ldquo;tea ceremonies&rdquo; known as the
Cha-no-yu came into vogue about the same time, and
undoubtedly had an immense influence on the ceramic
art. The articles used in the &ldquo;tea ceremonies&rdquo; included
an iron kettle resting on a stand; a table or stand of
mulberry wood 2 feet high; two tea-jars containing the
tea; a vessel containing fresh water; a tea-bowl. It is
not my purpose to describe the many interesting details of
these &ldquo;tea ceremonies.&rdquo; Suffice it to observe that they
gave a great impetus to the manufacture of costly and
elaborate china. The leaders of society, as we should
term them, who took part in these ceremonies exercised a
judicious and enlightened patronage of the ceramic art.
They encouraged rising talent, and welcomed new developments.
There can, I think, be no doubt that Japan, in an
artistic sense, owes much to the frequenters of these &ldquo;tea
ceremonies.&rdquo; Tea-jars and tea-bowls especially became,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
under the patronage and guidance of these men, choice
works of art, and were bestowed by the great and powerful
on their friends, by whom they were greatly cherished
and handed down as heirlooms. Some of these treasures
still remain in the country, a large number have been
purchased by art connoisseurs and taken to various parts
of the world, while many, of course, have from various
causes perished. Under the conditions of life which
obtained in old Japan the ceramic art reached a pitch
of excellence, not to say glory, which it is never likely to
attain either in Japan or elsewhere. It was emphatically
a period of art for art&rsquo;s sake. The patronage, if I may
use a word perhaps not strictly accurate, of the great
artists of those days was exercised in such a manner as to
enable them to employ all their talents, artistic ideals, and
enthusiasm in the direction of producing masterpieces of
their craft.</p>

<p>The secrets of porcelain manufacture are believed to
have been brought to Japan from China about the beginning
of the sixteenth century. In the year 1513, Gorodayu,
Shonsui, of Ise, returned from China and settled in Arita,
in the province of Hizen, which at once became and still
remains the headquarters of the famous Imari ware. The
porcelain produced here is chiefly, but not altogether, the
blue and white combination, but Arita also makes porcelain
ware decorated in various colours and exceedingly
ornate in appearance. It is, however, stated that this
ornate Imari ware was first made for exportation to China
to supply the Portuguese market at Macao, and that it
was afterwards fostered by the Dutch at Nagasaki,
whose exportations of the ware to Europe were on a
considerable scale. This peculiar style of decoration is
believed to have been due to the demands of the Dutch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
whose patrons in Europe would have none other. One
remark I may make in this connection, viz., that those
enormous vases and other similar articles of Japanese
ware which have long been so greatly prized in Europe,
and many of which are magnificent specimens of decorative
art, are not, in one sense, characteristically Japanese.
The Japanese has always, if I may so express it, used art
as the handmaiden of utilitarianism. Every article intended
for the Japanese home had to be not merely a
thing of beauty but a thing for use. It never entered the
minds of the Japanese to hang beautiful specimens of their
porcelain ware on their walls, or what did duty for walls,
to collect dust. They used vases certainly of a moderate
size to hold flowers, tea-pots and tea-cups for the purpose
of making and drinking tea, water-bottles and various
other articles for domestic use; everything in fact was, as
I have said, designed not only from an artistic but a
utilitarian standpoint, and hence it is, I think, that art,
as I have already remarked, has permeated the whole
people. Even in the poorest house in Japan it is possible
to see, in the ordinary articles in domestic use, some
attempt at art, and, I may add, some appreciation of it on
the part of the users of those articles. In my opinion
when art is not applied to articles of general utility but is
confined to articles not intended for use, art becomes, as is
largely the case in this country, either the cult of a class
or the affectation of a class, and its beauties and inward
meaning cease to have any effect upon, just because they
are not understood by, the great mass of the people.</p>

<p>Satsuma ware is probably the most widely known, and
the most esteemed among foreigners, of Japanese porcelain.
Its soft, cream-like colour is now known in every
part of the world, while the delicate colour decorations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
imposed upon the cream-like background, certainly give a
most effective appearance. I question however whether,
from a purely artistic standpoint, Satsuma is worthy of
being compared with many of the other porcelains in
Japan. Much of it as seen in Europe was specially made
for Europe, and having been so is, I suggest, not in the
true sense artistic. As a matter of fact Satsuma ware was
introduced from Korea, and was made in the first instance
solely for the use of the Prince of Satsuma and his friends.
The kilns were originally built on Korean models, and the
potters in Satsuma remained a class apart, not being
allowed to marry with the outside world.</p>

<p>Kaga ware is well known to all art connoisseurs. This
porcelain is rare. The masters of the art of Kaga ware,
with its exquisite colouring and elaborate ornamentation
in gold and silver, have left no successors, while their
output was small. The ware is of course still made, and as
the clay of the district is of a dark red colour, the ware
has a uniform tint.</p>

<p>Bizen ware reached the apotheosis of its perfection just
before the Revolution. It is made in the province of
Bizen. The better kind is made of a white or light bluish
clay, and well baked in order to receive the red-brown
colour, whereas the commoner kind is of a red clay.</p>

<p>The various Kyoto wares are remarkable for their quaint
forms, and some of them are highly prized.</p>

<p>It would, of course, be impossible for me to attempt in
detail a description of the other very numerous ceramic
wares of Japan. Undoubtedly, as I have said, Satsuma is
the most popular with Europeans, but it is not, and I do
not think it deserves to be, the most highly prized by
art connoisseurs. The ceramic wares of Japan may be
classified under three headings: (1) Pottery, ornamented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
by scoring and glazing; (2) A cream-coloured faience with
a glaze often crackled and delicately painted; (3) Hard
porcelain. Under the first of these classifications may be
included Bizen, Seto, Raku, and some other wares. Under
the second I place Satsuma and some less important
similar products. Among the porcelains the most famous
are those of Kutania, Hizen, and Kyoto. In regard to
decorations, the Japanese have utilised the seven gods of
good fortune, many landscapes, a few of the domestic
animals&mdash;the dragon, ph&oelig;nix, an animal with the body
and hoofs of a deer, the tail of a bull, and with a horn on
its forehead, a monster lion, and the sacred tortoise. Trees,
plants, grasses, and flowers of various kinds, and some of
the badges in Japanese heraldry are also largely made use
of. However grotesque some of these objects may be, or
however grotesque the representations of animals and even
landscapes may be, no one who has closely studied it can
deny the fact that the effect of Japanese decorative art as
applied to the ceramic ware of the country is, on the
whole, magnificent. The more one studies it the more
impressed one is with its marvellous beauty and the
originality which has been brought to bear upon it. I
defy any man or woman, who possesses the artistic sensibilities,
even in a latent degree, to visit a gallery containing
the masterpieces of Japanese ceramic art, closely study
them in all their details, and minutely examine the attention
which the artist has given to even the smallest of
those details without being impressed by its power. It is,
I consider, a liberal education to any person who has the
slightest prepossession for art to wander through such a
gallery and admire the masterpieces of these wonderful
art-workers of Japan.</p>

<p>The demand for the various art products of Japan in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
both Europe and America has had its perhaps inevitable
result in not only the manufacture of articles simply and
solely for the foreign market, but in the what I may term
faking of modern to represent ancient art productions.
&ldquo;Old&rdquo; Satsuma, for example, is a case in point. The
genuine old Satsuma ware, by constant use, obtained, like
meerschaum, a delightful tint. Modern Satsuma is comparatively
white, and so, in order to pander to the taste
of the European collector of the ancient article, the
modern is stained to the required shade. The article
itself is genuine, and indeed beautiful, but this &ldquo;faking&rdquo;
of it to meet European and American tastes is one of the
results, I fear, of Western influences. What the precise
effect of European influences may be on the old porcelain
art of Japan it is impossible to say. So far as I am concerned,
I have no hesitation in expressing my own opinion
that it will not be a healthy influence. Art for art&rsquo;s sake
is, I admit, difficult when the plutocrats of the West, with
a craze or a fad for Eastern art, are pouring out their
wealth in order to obtain specimens thereof. Demand
usually induces supply, and the Japanese artisan of
to-day would be more than human did he not respond
to the demand of the West for &ldquo;Old Satsuma&rdquo; and
other specimens of the artistic treasures in pottery and
porcelain of Japan. The spirit of commercialism is, as
I have said before, fatal to art. If the artist is forced to
work quickly and cheaply he quite evidently cannot bring
his individuality into play. He must transform his studio
into a workshop, and ponder only, or chiefly, upon the
possibility of his output. I have been much struck in
this connection with the remarks of a writer in regard to
orders for art work sent from New York to Japan. &ldquo;I
can remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one of our great New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
dealers marking on his samples the colours that pleased
most of his buyers, who themselves were to place the
goods. All other colours or patterns were tabooed in
his instructions to the makers in Japan. This was the
rude mechanism of the change, the coming down to the
worst public taste, which must be that of the greatest
number at any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As regards the modern porcelain of Japan I need say
but little. Originality is apparently dead, and the makers
of to-day are content to copy the past. No doubt the
purely mechanical processes of manufacture have been
greatly improved, and much, if not most, of the modern
ceramic ware of Japan is extremely beautiful. At the
same time some of it, especially that which is made
solely for the foreign market, is to my mind neither
artistic nor beautiful. It is decorated, if I may use such
a term, in most of the colours of the rainbow, and
rendered more gaudy still by a plethora of very poor
gilding.</p>

<p>There is in Japan a certain school of progressive ideas
in reference to the art of the country. This school is of
opinion that Japanese art should not, so to speak, remain
stereotyped, but that it should assimilate and adapt and
apply all that is good and beautiful in Western art. The
objects that this school has in view are no doubt laudable,
but I confess I hope with all my heart that those objects
will fail of accomplishment. There has been already far
too much Europeanising of Japanese art, and the result, so
far as I have been able to judge, is not encouraging in
respect of any further advance or development in that
direction. Japanese art, and especially the ceramic art,
possesses, as I have before said, an individuality which
can only be spoiled, even if it be not destroyed, by adding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
on to or mixing up with it the totally distinct art and art
methods of Western civilisation. Were this done it would
become a bastard or a mongrel art, and, as history
affords abundant evidence, would in due course lapse
into a condition of utter decadence.</p>

<p>Quite a volume might be written on the subject of
marks on Japanese pottery and porcelain. These have
long interested and frequently misled the collector.
They are of various kinds. Sometimes there is a mark
signifying the reign or part of the reign of an emperor,
or the name of a place at which the article was made,
or, more frequently still, the name of the particular potter
whose handicraft it was. Sometimes Chinese dates are
found impressed on the article without any regard to
chronological correctness. Indeed, Chinese dates are to
be found on Japanese porcelain indicating a period long
anterior to that in which the manufacture of porcelain was
known in Japan. These spurious dates have proved pitfalls
for collectors. The mark is sometimes impressed
with a seal or painted; occasionally it is merely scratched.
The investigation of these marks is a recondite study
assuredly full of interest, but, as I have said, prolific in
pitfalls for the unwary or the too-credulous.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>JAPANESE ART (<i>continued</i>)&mdash;SCULPTURE&mdash;METAL
WORK&mdash;PAINTING</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ROBABLY of all the Japanese arts there is none
more interesting or instructive than that of sculpture
in wood and ivory. The sculpture of Japan undoubtedly
had its origin in the service of the Buddhist religion.
That religion, as I have attempted to show, has always
utilised art in the decoration of its temples and shrines as
well as in the perpetuation of the image of Buddha himself.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century an
edict was promulgated directing that every house should
contain a representation of Buddha, and, as the result of
this, the sculpture trade received a considerable impetus.
Tobacco was introduced into the country in the same
century, and the smoking thereof soon came greatly into
vogue among the Japanese people. Tobacco necessitated
a pouch or bag to contain the same, and this in turn
induced or produced the manufacture of something
wherewith to attach the bag to the girdle. Hence the
evolution of the netsuk&eacute;, now as famous in Europe as
in Japan. The carving of netsuk&eacute;s developed into a very
high art; indeed, there is perhaps no branch of Japanese
art which has aroused more enthusiasm among foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
collectors and connoisseurs. Quite recently I attended
a sale of netsuk&eacute;s in London at which the bidding was
both fast and furious, while the prices realised were
enormous. The netsuk&eacute;, strictly speaking, was the
toggle attached by a cord to the tobacco pouch, inro,
or pipe of the Japanese man, with the object of preventing
the article slipping through the girdle or sash,
but the word has been more loosely employed by
foreigners until, in popular parlance, it has come to
embrace all small carvings. Netsuk&eacute;s were nearly
always representations of the human figure, and various
reasons have been advanced to account for this fact. I
need not consider those reasons in these pages, as they,
as well as the arguments by which they are attempted to
be supported, are almost entirely speculative. The distinguishing
characteristic of the true netsuk&eacute; is two holes
admitting of a string being run through them. These
holes were often concealed behind the limbs of the
figure. The material of which netsuk&eacute;s were made
varied, and consisted of ivory, wood horns, fish-bones,
and stones of various kinds. Those made of wood are
undoubtedly the most ancient, ivory being of comparatively
recent importation into Japan. Nevertheless, the
netsuk&eacute;s made of ivory now command the highest price.
The names of many of the great netsuk&eacute;-makers are
still famous, and much of their work is certainly artistic
and beautiful to a degree. I am afraid that in the collecting
of netsuk&eacute;s many European lovers of Japanese
art have burnt their fingers. The genuine old artistic
productions are now extremely rare, but a brisk trade
has sprung up in reproductions which are skilfully
coloured to give them the appearance of age. The
netsuk&eacute;, I must reiterate, was an almost indispensable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
adjunct to the costume of every Japanese man, and it
was, accordingly, made for use and not for ornament
alone. Of late years wood and ivory sculpture in Japan
has largely degenerated and deteriorated owing to the
output of articles not of utility, but made for the foreign
market&mdash;&ldquo;curios,&rdquo; in fact.</p>

<p>No one who has visited Japan can have failed of being
impressed by those gigantic statues of Buddha which have
been erected in different parts of the country. The largest
and best known is the Dai Butsu, at Kamakura, a few
miles from Yokohama. The height of this great statue is
nearly 50 feet, in circumference it is 97 feet. The length
of the face is 8 feet 5 inches, the width of mouth 3 feet
2 inches, and it has been asserted&mdash;though I do not
guarantee the accuracy of the calculation&mdash;that there are
830 curls upon the head, each curl 9 inches long. The
statue is composed of layers of bronze brazed together.
It is hollow, and persons can ascend by a ladder into
the interior. The Dai Butsu at Nara is taller than the
one at Kamakura. It is dissimilar to most of the others
in the country in having a black face of a somewhat
African type. This image is stated to have been erected
in the year 750 <small>A.D.</small>, and the head has, I believe, been
replaced several times. In the Kamakura Dai Butsu
both hands rest upon the knees, while in the one at Nara
the right arm is extended upward with the palm of the
hand placed to the front. The statue at Nara is made of
bronze which is stated to be composed of gold 500,
mercury 1,950, tin 16,827, and copper 986,080 lbs., the total
weight of the statue being about 480 tons. Nearly all the
Dai Butsus in the country are of ancient workmanship.
There is a modern one constructed of wood erected in the
year 1800 at Kyoto, 60 feet high. As a work of art it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
has, however, no pretensions, which rest entirely upon
its size.</p>

<p>Criticisms in regard to the artistic merits of these
immense images have been numerous and by no means
unanimous. To my mind they are superb specimens of
the work of the old metallurgists of Japan, and they are,
moreover, deeply interesting as indicative of the ideas of
their designers in regard to the expression of placid repose
of Nirvana. Mr. Basil Chamberlain has appositely remarked
in reference to the great statue at Kamakura:
&ldquo;No other gives such an impression of majesty or so truly
symbolises the central idea of Buddhism, the intellectual
calm which comes of perfected knowledge and the subjugation
of all passion.&rdquo; And Lafcadio Hearn, that learned
authority on everything Japanese, who has brought into
all his writings a poetical feeling which breathes the very
spirit of old Japan, has observed in regard to the same
statue: &ldquo;The gentleness, the dreamy passionlessness of
those features&mdash;the immense repose of the whole figure&mdash;are
full of beauty and charm. And, contrary to all
expectations, the nearer you approach the giant Buddha
the greater the charm becomes. You look up into the
solemnly beautiful face&mdash;into the half-closed eyes, that
seem to watch you through their eyelids of bronze as
gently as those of a child; and you feel that the image
typifies all that is tender and solemn in the soul of the
East. Yet you feel also that only Japanese thought could
have created it. Its beauty, its dignity, its perfect repose,
reflect the higher life of the race that imagined it, and,
though inspired doubtless by some Indian model, as the
treatment of his hair and various symbolic marks reveal,
the art is Japanese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So mighty and beautiful is the work that you will for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
some time fail to notice the magnificent lotus plants of
bronze, fully 15 feet high, planted before the figure on
another side of the great tripod in which incense rods are
burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kaemfer, writing in the seventeenth century, remarked
of the Japanese: &ldquo;As to all sorts of handicraft, they are
wanting neither proper materials nor industry and application,
and so far is it that they should have any occasion to
send for masters abroad, that they rather exceed all other
nations in ingenuity and neatness of workmanship, particularly
in brass, gold, silver, and copper.&rdquo; In metal work
the Japanese have certainly cultivated art to a high degree.
Much of that metal work was, of course, employed in connection
with articles which modern conditions of life in
Japan have rendered absolutely or almost entirely obsolete.
The bronze workers of Japan were and indeed are still
famous. Their work as displayed in braziers, incense-holders,
flower-vases, lanterns, and various other articles
evinces great skill, while the effects often produced by the
artists in the inlaying and overlaying of metals with a view
of producing a variegated picture has long been the wonder
and admiration of the Western world. It is almost safe to
assert that the finest specimens of work of this kind can
never be reproduced. In casting, too, there was no lack of
skill in old Japan. The big bell at Kyoto, which is
14 feet high by over 9 feet in diameter, is a sufficient
object-lesson as to the proficiency attained in casting in
bygone days. Much of the bronze work of Japan, especially
in birds and insects, is to me incomparable. The modern
bronze work of the country, though certainly beautiful,
does not in any respect or any degree approach that of the
masters of two or three hundred years ago. In the manipulation
of metals and amalgams these men have reached a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
higher standard of perfection than had previously or has
since been attained. The bronze work of Japan is not, in
my opinion, as generally appreciated as it deserves to be.
There is, I think, nothing of the same kind in the world to
be compared with it when it was at its best. Like much
of the other art of Japan modern conditions are, as I have
said, not conducive either to its progress or development.
Still, there is no lack of skill in this particular branch of
art in Japan at the present time, and I have seen some
very admirable, not to say magnificent, specimens of
modern bronze work.</p>

<p>Armour is now nearly as effete in Japan as in this
country, and yet in the decoration of armour the Japanese
artist in metal was in the past not only skilful but
beautiful. Fine specimens of armour are now extremely
rare. That particular kind of work has, of course, gone
never to return. Next in importance to armour came the
sword. Some of us can remember when the two-sworded
men of Japan were still actualities, not, as they have now
become, historical entities, the terror of the foreign community
there. The sword was an important and, indeed,
an essential weapon in the conditions of society that
obtained in old Japan, not only for self-defence but for
offensive purposes, either in respect of family feuds or
individual quarrels, which were almost invariably settled
by the arbitrament of the sword. That weapon was also
used for those suicides known as hara-kiri, the outcome
of wounded honour or self-respect, which were such
prominent features in the Japanese life of the past. Some
Western writers have attempted to poke a mild kind of
fun at this proneness of the Japanese for the &ldquo;happy
despatch&rdquo; on what seemed to the writers very flimsy
or trivial grounds. To me, on the contrary, the practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of hara-kiri, indefensible as it may be in some respects,
indicates the existence of a high code of honour, the
slightest infringement of which rendered life intolerable.
The sword then had innumerable functions, and, like
almost every article of utility in Japan, it became the
subject of elaborate ornamentation. The blade itself was
brought to a high state of perfection, and as regards the
tempering of the steel has been the admiration of cutlers
in every part of the globe. Indeed the sword-makers of
Japan are famous from the tenth century downwards.
Many of the sword-blades had mottoes inscribed on them,
and most had designs ornate and often elaborate. The
accessories of the blade and the ornamentation thereof
lent full scope for that artistic adornment which has for
ages past, as I have more than once remarked, been
characteristic of almost every article used in Japan. The
wearing of the sword was confined to persons of a certain
rank, and different classes wore different kinds of swords.
About the sixteenth century the custom of wearing two
swords, one large, the other about the size of a dirk, came
into fashion. The two-handed sword was essentially a
war sword. The colour of the scabbard was almost invariably
black with a tinge of red or green, and it was in
most instances beautifully lacquered. The possessor of a
sword gave full vent to his tastes in regard to the size
and decoration of his weapon. According to Griffis:
&ldquo;Daimios often spent extravagant sums upon a single
sword and small fortunes upon a collection. A Samurai,
however poor, would have a blade of sure temper and rich
mountings, deeming it honourable to suffer for food that he
might have a worthy emblem of his rank.&rdquo; On January 1,
1877, the wearing of swords was abolished by an Imperial
decree, and foreigners visiting or resident in Japan in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and the following years were able to pick up magnificent
swords for a few dollars each.</p>

<p>I have not space to describe in detail the many
accessories which went to form the complete sword for the
strong man armed in old Japan, or the elaborate and
artistic ornamentation of every detail. In many of the
small pieces of metal work which adorned the swords gold,
silver, platina, copper, iron, steel, zinc, besides numerous
alloys were used. The abolition of sword-wearing gave a
death-blow to the industry in connection with the making
of swords except in so far as it has been continued for the
purpose of turning them out for the European market.
But during the many centuries the art of metal work, as
exemplified in sword manufacture and the ornamentation
of the sword and the various accessories of it, existed in
Japan it reached a magnificent height of perfection.
Dealing only with one period of it a French writer has
remarked: &ldquo;What a galaxy of masters illuminated the close
of the eighteenth century! What a multitude of names
and works would have to be cited in any attempt to write
a monograph upon sword furniture! The humblest artisan,
in this universal outburst of art, is superior in his mastery
of metal to any one we could name in Europe. How many
artists worthy of a place in the rank are only known to us
by a single piece, but which is quite sufficient to evidence
their power! From 1790 to 1840 art was at fever heat,
the creative faculty produced marvels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides the making and ornamentation of swords the
metal workers in Japan attained great skill in the design
and finish of many other articles which were in constant
use by the people&mdash;pipes, cases to hold the Indian ink
which formed the writing material, the clasps and buttons
of tobacco pouches, besides vases, &amp;c. In reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
making of alloys these metal workers showed considerable
ingenuity, the alloys used, amalgams of gold, silver,
copper, and other metals in deft proportions, resulting in
magnificent effects as regards ornamentation and permanency.
Japan has undoubtedly been greatly aided in
the height to which the art of the country of various kinds
has attained by the plentifulness of minerals therein.
Gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, and many other minerals
exist. Strange to say, gold at one time was considered no
more valuable than silver&mdash;a fact which may account for
the lavish manner in which it was used for decorative
purposes in art of all descriptions.</p>

<p>I fear that an inevitable result of Western influences and
the great, indeed drastic, changes which have been effected
thereby in the ideas, manners, and customs of the Japanese
people has been the decay, if not the destruction, of the
art connected with metal work. Sword manufacture and
everything relating thereto is, of course, gone; other metal
industries are following suit. The result, as I have said,
was inevitable, but it is none the less deplorable. Although
it requires an expert to deal with and describe in all its
infinite detail the metal work of Japan, it does not need
an expert&rsquo;s knowledge to profoundly admire it and be lost
in admiration at the skill displayed and the pains taken in
respect of every part of it. The workers in this, as indeed
in all the other art industries of Japan in the past, were
quite evidently not men in a hurry or much exercised
concerning their output, and scamping their work in order
to establish a record. Their hearts must have been in
everything they undertook, and their sole aim, whatever
they did, to put into their work all their skill and knowledge
and love of the beautiful. They, in fact, worked not
for pelf but for sheer love of art, and so long as the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of these artists of various kinds endures the world will
assuredly never cease to admire it.</p>

<p>Painting has, in Japan, long been greatly cultivated, and
in some respects highly developed. There are various
recognised schools of painting, but I shall not weary my
readers with any attempt, necessarily imperfect as it would
be, to describe them in detail. China and the Buddhist
religion have profoundly influenced painting as the other
arts of Japan. Indeed, the early painters of Japan devoted
themselves almost entirely to religious subjects. Most of
their work was executed on the walls, ceilings, and sliding
screens of the Buddhist temples, but some of it still exists
in kakemonos, or wall pictures, and makimonos, or scroll
pictures. In the ninth century painting, as well as the arts
of architecture and carving, flourished exceedingly. Kyoto
appears to have been the great artistic centre. The
construction of temples throughout the country proceeded
apace, and it is related that no less than 13,000 images
were carved and painted during the reign of one emperor.
Kyoto was, in fact, the centre of religious art. We are
told that the entire city was in a constant artistic ferment,
that whole streets were converted into studios and workshops,
and that the population of idols and images was
as numerous as the human habitation. Nearly all the
temples then constructed and adorned have vanished, but
that at Shiba still remains to convey to us some idea of
the artistic glories of this period of intense religious belief,
which gave expression to its fervour and its faith in
architecture, carving, and painting. About the thirteenth
century flower and still-life painting came into vogue.
Almost simultaneously religious fervour, as expressed in
art, began to grow cold. The artist became the hanger-on
of the Daimio, who was too often employed in burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
temples and destroying their artistic treasures. The
painter then painted as his fancy led him, and if he treated
of religious subjects did not invariably do so in a reverential
spirit. From time to time new schools of painting arose,
culminating, in the eighteenth century, in the Shijo school,
which made a feature of painting animals, birds, fishes,
flowers, &amp;c., from nature, instead of adhering to the
conventional style which had previously prevailed. The
colouring of some of the work of this school is superb and
is greatly in request among art collectors.</p>

<p>Of late years painting in Japan seems, to some extent,
to have come under Western influences. There is, indeed,
a progressive party in painting which not only does not
resist these Western influences but actually advocates the
utilisation of Western materials and methods in painting
and the discarding of all that had made Japanese painting
essentially what it is. I confess to a hope that this
progressive school will not make quite so much progress
as its disciples desire. To introduce European pigments,
canvas, brushes, &amp;c., and discard the materials formerly in
use, to get rid of the Japanese method of treating subjects,
whether landscapes, country scenes, the life of the people,
representations of animals, and so on, and replace that
method by imitations of European schools of painting,
must simply involve the destruction of all that is essentially
and characteristically Japanese and the replacing of it by
something that is not Japanese or indeed Oriental. The
essence of art is originality. I admit that art may come
under foreign influences and be improved, just as it may
be degraded, by them. If the influences of foreign art are
to be advantageous that art must, I suggest, be in some
measure akin to the style of the art which is affected by it.
For example, the influence in the past of China or Korea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
upon an analogous style of art in Japan. But for Japanese
painters to remodel their peculiar style upon that of
Europe must prove as fatal to Japanese painting as an art
as any similar endeavour of European painters to remodel
their style upon that of Japan would be fatal to the
distinctive art of Europe. I make this statement with
full knowledge of the fact that some art critics in this
country declare that Mr. Whistler and other artists have
been largely affected or influenced in their style by a study
of Japanese art in painting and its methods.</p>

<p>I have referred to kakemonos, those wall pictures which
are such a pleasing feature of the simple decoration of
Japanese houses. Many of these are superb specimens of
art, and the same remark may be made in reference to the
makimonos, or scroll pictures. It may be that not every
Western eye can appreciate these Japanese paintings fully
at a first glance, but they certainly grow upon one, and I
hope the time is far distant when kakemonos will be
replaced in Japanese homes by those mural decorations, if
I may so term them, to be seen in so many English
houses, which are a positive eyesore to any person with
even the faintest conception of art. The work of the old
painters of Japan, as it appears on kakemonos and
makimonos, is now rare. Much of it, as is the case with
the other art treasures of the country, has gone abroad.
I am, however, of opinion that painting has not deteriorated
to anything like the same extent as some of the other
Japanese arts. The subjects depicted by the artists have
during the centuries from time to time changed, but the
technique has altered but little. It does not, I know,
appeal to everybody, but it is the kind of art, I reiterate,
that grows upon one. No person who has interested
himself in painting in modern Japan, especially on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
kakemonos, can, I think, have failed to be impressed by the
exquisite and beautiful work which the Japanese artists
in colour to-day produce.</p>

<p>Silk and satin embroidery as an industry and an art at
one time attained considerable importance in Japan, but
of recent years has greatly declined. The craze among
the upper classes for European dress has, of course,
seriously affected the demand for elaborately embroidered
silk and satin garments, and is bound to affect it to an
even greater extent in the future as the custom of wearing
European garb spreads among the people. No one with
any artistic sensibilities can help regretting the fact that
Japan is gradually but surely discarding the distinctive
costume of her people. That costume was in every
respect appropriate to their physique and facial characteristics.
The same certainly cannot be said of European
attire. However, it is now, I suppose, hopeless to arrest
the movement in this direction, and in a comparatively
few years, no doubt, the ancient and historic dress of the
Japanese people will be as obsolete as the silks, satins,
ruffles, &amp;c., of our forefathers.</p>

<p>And what remark shall I make of Japanese curios, the
trade in which has assumed such very large dimensions?
Have they no claim, some of my readers may ask, to be
included in a chapter on art? There is no doubt that
many purchasers of them would be shocked were they to
be told that there was nothing artistic in many, if not
most, of these articles, that they were made simply and
solely for the European market, and that the manufacture
of curios for this purpose was now just as much a trade as
is the making of screws in Birmingham. I am quite
prepared to admit that some of the articles included in the
generic term &ldquo;curios,&rdquo; which can now be purchased in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
large town in Great Britain, are pretty and effective, but as
regards many of them there is certainly nothing artistic or
indeed particularly or peculiarly Japanese. This making
of curios for the foreign market has, as I have said,
assumed considerable dimensions in Japan of recent years,
and in connection therewith the Japanese has certainly
assimilated many Western ideas in reference to pushing
his wares. As an example in point of this I will quote
here an anecdote told me by a friend who had a considerable
knowledge of Japan in the &rsquo;seventies. During one
of his journeyings inland, when staying at a Japanese
tea-house, he was initiated into the use of Japanese
tooth-powder, which is in pretty general use among the
lower classes. On leaving Japan he purchased and
brought to England a considerable quantity of this tooth-powder,
and on settling down in London he discovered a
Japanese shop where it was on sale. For some seventeen
or eighteen years he purchased the tooth-powder at the
shop, sold in the little boxes in which it was vended in
Japan, not only using it himself but introducing it to a
large number of his acquaintances. One day last year,
on going into the shop referred to to make a further
purchase, he was informed that they were run out of
tooth-powder and did not quite know if they would have
any more. My friend returned a month or two later to
the same shop on the same errand bent, and asked if they
had received a fresh supply. He was told that a further
supply had come to hand of very much the same description,
but at double the price. He purchased a box, the
outside of which bore the following inscription in English:
&ldquo;Japanese Sanitary Dentifrice; Superior Quality. Apply
the powder to the teeth by means of a brush, using
moderate friction over the whole surface.&rdquo; On opening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the box my friend found the powder was perfumed&mdash;perfumed
for the European market! Now tooth-powder
is, of course, not a curio, nor is the expression &ldquo;moderate
friction over the whole surface,&rdquo; I may remark, characteristically
Japanese. The little anecdote is, I think, typical
of the change that has come over and is still actively in
progress in Japan&mdash;a change which, however inevitable,
and beneficial though in many respects I believe it to be,
is most assuredly not beneficial to the interests of art of
any kind.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the hurry-scurry of
modern civilisation is not conducive to artistic work of
any description. The man in a hurry is unlikely to
accomplish anything of permanent value. Working
against time is utterly subversive of the realisation of
artistic ideals. The past, whether in the West or the
East, when railways, telegraphs, telephones, newspapers,
and all the adjuncts of modern progress were unknown,
was the period when men did good and enduring work.
They could then concentrate their minds upon their art
free from those hundred-and-one discomposing and disconcerting
influences which are the concomitants of
modern civilisation. The true artist thinks only of his
art; for him it is not merely a predominant, but his sole
interest. He brings to it all his mind, his ideas and ideals,
his energy, enthusiasm, pertinacity; in it is concentrated
all his ambition. Extraneous matters can only distract
his mind from his art, and accordingly are to be abjured.
I fear this exclusiveness, this aloofness, is rare nowadays in
the West; it is perhaps less rare in the East, but it is becoming
rarer there as Western influences, Western ideas,
and Western modes of life and method of regarding life
make progress. The poet, the painter, the sculptor, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
novelist, the dramatist, if their work is to be other than
ephemeral, need an atmosphere of repose and quietude
wherein the mind can work and fashion those ideas which
are to be given material expression free from all distracting
and disturbing influences. Where can the aspiring artist,
under modern conditions of life, find such a haven of rest?
And even if he find it I fear he too often has no desire to
cast anchor there. The distractions of life are frequently
alluring, and the embryonic artists of to-day assure us
that they must, in modern jargon, keep &ldquo;in touch&rdquo; with
modern thought with a view of, in modern slang, being
&ldquo;up-to-date.&rdquo; Ideas such as these&mdash;and they seem to me
to be not only largely prevalent but almost universal&mdash;are
in my opinion fatal, not only to the development but to
the very existence of art. We see in this country the
effect upon every department thereof. Poetry, painting,
sculpture, literature, the drama, are by almost general
consent in a state of utter decadence. The great poet or
painter, the great artist in words, on canvas, in marble, or
in wood&mdash;where is he? Are there any signs or portents of
his advent? None. Modern conditions of life have killed
the artist, and replaced him by artistic mediocrities or
mechanicians who labour not for love but for lucre, and
are more concerned about the amount of their output
than the quality thereof. And as of England and Europe
so I fear is it, and will it be to a greater extent, in the near
future in Japan. The artist in lacquer, porcelain, metal,
painting, embroidery, cannot exist under the conditions of
modern progress. He may still produce good and beautiful
work, but it will be no longer artistic in the higher sense
of that word, just because those ideas and ideals which
make the artist and connote art cannot exist in their
fulness and purity amidst the hurry and bustle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
turmoil and desire for wealth which are the essential
characteristics of the civilisation of Europe and America
to-day&mdash;a civilisation which Japan has imported, and to
a large degree assimilated, and which she must accept
with its defects as well as its advantages. We may, and
must, regret the effect of this civilisation upon the art of
old Japan, but there is no good shutting one&rsquo;s eyes to
obvious facts or affecting to believe that in due course we
shall witness a renaissance in Japan, a new birth of all
that is great and grand and magnificent in her past
history.</p>

<p>There has for some years been a movement to prevent,
as far as possible, the passing out of Japan of its art
treasures. The Government has diligently catalogued all
that remain in the temples and public buildings to obviate
their being sold, and museums have been built for the
purpose of collecting and exhibiting all that is best and
representative of Japanese art There has also been a
movement among the noblemen and the upper classes in
the direction of forming private collections. It was time
that steps such as these should be taken. It is a thousand
pities they were not taken earlier. The drain of Japan&rsquo;s
art treasures went on unchecked year after year, and it is
probable that the private and public collections of Europe
and America contain more Japanese art treasures than are
now to be found in Japan itself. I am aware that in these
collections are also to be found no little of the spurious,
and many articles with no claim to be considered artistic
in any sense of the word, but at the same time there is no
doubt that, as I have said, for years, there was a constant
export of artistic wealth from Japan. The Revolution of
1868, with its consequent cataclysms, caused the treasures
of many of the great families to come on the market, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the result that they were bought up at prices often greatly
below their intrinsic value and shipped from the country.
They are of course gone for ever, and the only thing that
now remains to Japan is to prevent as far as possible any
of the treasures which she possesses meeting with a similar
fate. I know perfectly well that art, like music, knows
nothing of nationality, and that there is no reason why the
resident of London or New York should not enjoy the
beauties of Japanese art, and feast his eyes on the work of
some great Japanese artist of three or four hundred years
back just as much as the citizen of Tokio. This is in one
sense true, but at the same time one cannot help sympathising
with the patriotic desire of a people to retain in
their midst specimens of the artistic conceptions and the
artistic work of those famous men who are now ashes, but
whose work remains as a symbol and an incentive to their
countrymen to maintain a high standard, and to practise
art simply and solely for the love of it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are, perhaps, some superior persons who may
consider that Japanese architecture has no claim
to be regarded as art. These persons have no conception
of art in architecture unless it be Doric, Gothic, Byzantine,
Early English, or something of the kind, and unless it be
expressed in bricks and mortar. Now Japanese architecture
is only wood, but though only wood, as regards its
majestic beauty, seemliness, and adaptability to the
purposes for which it is intended, it stands unique. Moreover,
it is the only timber architecture in the world that
has attained in any degree artistic importance. Almost
every building in Japan is, or, to speak more accurately,
was, constructed of wood&mdash;a fact possibly due to the interminable
earthquakes to which the country was long, and is
still occasionally, subjected. In Japanese architecture no
brick or stone is used unless it be for foundations; nevertheless,
this restriction to wood material has not prevented
the Japanese architects of the past raising stupendous
structures which in beauty of adornment and durability
have long been the admiration of the Western world.
The Temple of Nara, for example, was constructed three
hundred years before the foundations of Westminster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Abbey were laid. As Dr. Dresser has pertinently remarked
in this connection: &ldquo;What buildings can we show
in England which have existed since the eighth century
and are yet almost as perfect as when first built? and yet
our buildings rest on a solid foundation, and not on earth
which is constantly rocked by natural convulsions.&rdquo; The
porch of the temple of Todaji is erected upon pillars
100 feet high by 12 feet in circumference, and yet this
porch is merely the entrance to another porch equally
large, which again is itself the approach to the temple
containing an image of Buddha 53 feet high with a halo
83 feet in diameter. The sanctuary of the ancient
temple at Nara, already referred to, has columns quite
100 feet high consisting of a single stem. These ancient
fanes are not bald architectural ruins. Their decoration,
as ancient as the building itself, is quite as permanent.
They are ablaze in every part with majestic decorations
in gold and all the colours of the rainbow, as gorgeous
and impressive now as they were when first applied by
the hands of the decorators more than a thousand years
ago. As a recent writer on this subject has appositely
remarked: &ldquo;It is in detail the Japanese architect most
excels, for if he conceives like a giant he invariably
finishes like a jeweller. Every detail to the very nails,
which are not dull surfaces but rendered exquisite
ornaments, is a work of art. Everywhere we encounter
friezes and carvings in relief, representing in quaint
colour harmonies flowers and birds, or heavenly spirits
playing upon flutes and stringed instruments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must often strike the thinking man as a curious fact
that these old religious edifices, whether in Europe or the
Far East, seem to have a permanence about them such as
is not characteristic of modern buildings of the same kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
The reason, I think, must have been that the men who
were employed in the designing and construction of these
ancient buildings, whether in the East or West, were not
mere mercenaries employed for a particular purpose, but
men full of faith in their religion, a building in whose
honour and for whose services they were employed to
erect, and who threw into their work their whole souls,
so to speak&mdash;gave, in fact, the best of what they had, and
employed all their zeal, energy, and enthusiasm with a
view of perpetuating, whether in stone, brick, or wood, the
faith they so firmly held and so dearly loved.</p>

<p>Some of the problems that the Japanese builders of the
past had to face in the erection of a few of the great
temples which still adorn the country have proved insoluble
to many European engineers and architects. The
erection and support of the magnificent pagoda at Nikko
is an example in point. Dr. Dresser has referred to this
and pointed out what he deemed a great waste of material
in connection therewith. He failed to understand for what
reason an enormous log of wood ascended in the centre of
a structure from its base to the apex&mdash;a log of wood about
2 feet in diameter&mdash;while near the lower end one equally
large was bolted to each of the four sides of the central
mass. When Dr. Dresser expressed surprise on the subject
he was told that the walls must be strong enough to
support the central block; and on his pointing out that
the central block was not supported by the sides, he was
taken up to the top of the building and the fact demonstrated
to him that the huge central mass was suspended
like the clapper of a bell. On descending again, while
lying on the ground, he saw that there was quite an inch
of space between the soil and the great pendulum&mdash;a safeguard
against damage by earthquake. For many hundreds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of years the centre of gravity of this building has, by its
swinging, been kept within the base, and the fact shows,
were evidence needed, that the Japanese architects who
designed this great Nikko Pagoda and similar structures
were men of scientific capacities who had thought out
every problem connected with the safety and permanence
of the building they were employed to design.</p>

<p>The domestic dwellings of the great mass of the
Japanese people are of the simplest possible type. They
are no doubt evolved from the hut of the Ainos, probably
the aborigines of the islands, still to be found in the island
of Yesso. There are no walls as we understand the term,
the sides being composed, in winter, of amado, or sliding
screens made of wood, and in summer of shoji, or oil-paper
slides. This enables, in hot weather, the whole of the
side of the house to be moved, and the air to be given free
ingress and egress. Nor are these habitations divided off
into permanent rooms, as in this and other European
countries. Paper screens which slide into grooves divide
the space according to requirements. The wood-work of
these dwellings, which are largely composed of camphor-wood,
is both within and without left unpainted, and they
generally present a neat and alluring appearance. When
one compares the dwelling-places of the poorest inhabitants
of Japan with the hovels in this country, and more
especially in Ireland, occupied by the peasants, one is
really lost in wonder at the ignorance of those persons
who call Japan, and no doubt still believe it to have
been, an uncivilised country until it was brought intimately
into association with Occidental nations.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">TEA HOUSE, NEAR TOKIO<br />

<small>FROM A PRINT BY HIROSHIGE</small></p>

<p>As we ascend in the social scale in Japan we find, of
course, a difference in architecture. The principle remains
very much the same, but, as might be expected, the buildings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
are more elaborate and there is a wealth of ornamentation
which is absent from those of the lower classes.
I am inclined to think that what I may call ecclesiastical
art has largely influenced the decoration of the houses of
the nobles and upper classes in Japan. Many of the old
feudal castles, which were gems of Japanese architecture,
no longer exist, but some of those which still remain are
exceedingly beautiful specimens of wooden architecture.
The castle of Nagoya, built in the early part of the seventeenth
century, is supposed to be the finest specimen of
the kind in Japan.</p>

<p>But the Japanese never seems to have been overmuch
concerned respecting his dwelling. To comprehend the
beauty of Japanese architecture, to see it in its purity and
to realise all the grandeur that can be crowded into it, it is
necessary to study it in the religious edifices of the country.
Plainness is the characteristic of the Shinto temple; built
as a rule of pine, it has a thatched roof. The fact of its
being an edifice of the Shinto religion is self-evident from
the torii which stand before every Shinto temple. There
are no idols or exterior ornamentation of any kind. The
walls are left untouched by either the painter or the
lacquerer. In the Buddhist temples, on the contrary,
the Japanese artist has had afforded him full scope for the
exercise of his ornamental ingenuity. Numerous courtyards
have to be traversed before reaching the temple
itself. These courtyards contain many small buildings,
bronze or stone lanterns, belfries, pavilions, pagodas,
&amp;c., &amp;c., all elaborately decorated. Amongst the supplementary
buildings connected with, but occasionally independent
of, Buddhist temples, none is more interesting
than the pagoda so intimately associated with Buddhism
in every part of the Far East and so typically Oriental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in its architecture. What may have been the precise
origin of these five-&nbsp;or seven-storied erections, for what
purpose they were intended, or what symbolism, if any,
they were the expression of, is now largely a matter of
conjecture. No one who has visited the East can at any
rate have failed to be impressed by them. In Japan
where, save the lower storey, the whole is lacquered red,
they are a striking feature of the country. The lower
storey, by the way, is decorated with numerous painted
carvings. Topping the whole building is the twisted spire
of bronze.</p>

<p>Like most other things in Japan, the origin and development
of the architecture of the country is lost in the
twilight of obscurity. Korea appears to have influenced
Japanese architecture, just as it has Japanese art of various
kinds. It is an extraordinary fact that this portion of
Asia contiguous to the Japanese islands, which has for so
many hundreds of years past exercised such a subtle
influence on the art and industries of Japan, should at the
commencement of the twentieth century have passed
under the suzerainty of that country. When one fully
comprehends the connection in various ways of Korea
with Japan in all the past centuries, one begins to understand
the sentimental feeling which has influenced the
whole nation in regard to the possibility of Korea passing
under the domination of any other Power. At the beginning
of the third century Korea was invaded by Japan
and, although the country was then conquered, it, as has
not infrequently under similar circumstances happened in
history, exercised a potent effect on both the art and
architecture of Japan. Korean architecture, of course,
was not original; it was based on that of China, which in
its turn came from Burmah, and that again probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
from India. In the course of the seventh century, however,
the imported architecture more or less assumed the
general style which has since remained distinctly Japanese
and although it undoubtedly embodies everything that
was best in the architecture of the countries from which it
derived its essential features, appears to me to have an
originality of its own. No man who has not visited the
great temples at Shiba and Nikko can understand to what
heights of sublimity wooden architecture can rise, what a
gorgeous <i>tout ensemble</i> can be accomplished by harmonious
colour schemes deftly blended by artists who had made a
study of colour and all the details connected therewith,
and knew how to render a picturesque effect which should
be imposing without being either gaudy or glaring.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the results of Western civilisation have
been, and will continue to be, fatal to Japanese architects.
Judging by the buildings which have been erected in the
country since Western influences have reigned supreme
Japanese architecture is not only dead but buried. These
edifices&mdash;hotels, Government buildings, railway stations
and so on, are an attempt to combine Western and
Japanese styles. The result is an incongruity, to express
it mildly, sufficient to cause the artistic mind to
shudder. The men who built the temples at Shiba, at
Nikko, and in various other parts of the country, and
the pagodas which dot the land, are dead, and have
left no successors. There is nothing, in my opinion, that
is more likely to be influenced, and more injuriously influenced,
by Western ideas than the architecture of Japan.
There is a tendency in the country to erect European
buildings, and I suppose it is one that it is impossible to
complain of. The Japanese houses, although they have
advantages in the summer-time, are undoubtedly not well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fitted to withstand the rigours of winter; and I have no
doubt that, from the standpoint of material comfort, a
replacement of them by buildings erected on European
lines might be an advantage. But from the artistic point
of view such a change is one impossible to contemplate
without a feeling of regret.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no human possibility of temples
such as those at Shiba and Nikko ever again being erected
in Japan. As I have previously remarked, buildings such
as these are something more than mere material constructions;
they are the embodiment in material form of
a living faith which the designers and builders attempted
to set forth in their work. An age of disbelief, of
indifference, of agnosticism, is not conducive to the construction
of such edifices. We need not go to Japan for
evidence of that obvious fact. The hideous monstrosities
in the shape of cathedrals, churches, and chapels that have
been built in this country during the past century or two
are abundant proof, were any needed, that the faith and
piety whose outward and visible manifestation is to be
seen in Westminster Abbey, Canterbury Cathedral, York
Minster, and various other noble architectural fanes is no
longer with us; it has gone, and, apparently, inspiration
with it. We can now only construct walls, and put roofs
on them&mdash;admirable edifices, no doubt, to keep out the
rain, but signifying nothing from an artistic or idealistic
point of view. And so it is in regard to Japan. Architecture
there, considered as an art, is dead. It may be
imitated or reproduced, but the reproduction will impose
on no person of artistic sensibilities or knowledge, any
more than a Sheraton reproduction hailing from the
Tottenham Court Road would impose on a connoisseur
as the genuine work of that great artist in furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
The art of Japan has, especially since the opening up
of the country, been closely studied and investigated, and
many learned tomes have been written concerning it. I do
not, however, think that the art of the country as expressed
in its architecture has received anything like the attention
it deserves. This may possibly arise from the fact, to
which I have already referred, that many people have
what I may term a restricted definition or conception of
art. Others there are, again, who consider wooden architecture
to be almost a contradiction in terms. Words or
definitions in a matter of this kind seem to me to be
childish. The lover of the beautiful, the admirer of the
historic, the investigator of the ebb and flow of religious
systems and of the sentiments and spirit that have
influenced and moulded them at different periods of their
existence, can in the ancient wooden temples of Japan
find abundant material for enjoyment, instruction, reflection.
I have no hesitation in including these buildings in
that surely expansive and comprehensive term, Art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>POSTAL AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE advancement of a nation, may, I think, be
accurately gauged by the facilities it possesses or
has developed for the communication of its inhabitants,
either by personal intercourse or those other means which
science has of late years discovered or evolved for the
transmission of thought, whether on business or otherwise&mdash;the
letter post, the telegraph, and the telephone.
I accordingly purpose briefly describing the extent to
which, in these respects, Japan has assimilated and utilised
Western ideas.</p>

<p>I have already touched on the matter of railway communication,
so I will not again refer to it in any detail.
I may, however, remark that although railways in Japan
have done much to open up the country and provide for
more frequent and rapid intercourse between man and
man, they still lack much in the matter of European
ideas of comfort. There are three classes of carriages,
and the fares of each are extremely low. The gauge is
narrow; the carriages are open, as in America, with one
long seat running down each side and a shorter one at the
end. In the first-class carriages tea is provided, a kettle
and tea-pot wherein to make the beverage being placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on the floor between the seats for the use of passengers.
No doubt ere long the Japanese will be more impressed
than they appear to be at present as to the necessity for
express trains, high speeds, Pullman and restaurant cars,
as well as for other now indispensable characteristics of
English and American railways. The initial railway line
in Japan was that between Yokohama and the capital. It
was popular and well patronised from the first, in contradistinction
to the record of railways in China, where the
initial line&mdash;that between Shanghai and Wusung&mdash;had to
be bought up and pulled up by the Chinese authorities, in
view of the number of Chinamen who persisted in committing
suicide by placing themselves in front of the train
as a protest&mdash;and a most effective protest, it must be
admitted&mdash;against the introduction into their country of
this contrivance of the &ldquo;foreign devils.&rdquo; The contrast in
the manner in which the introduction of railways was
received in China and Japan respectively is, I think,
characteristic of the difference in the disposition and
mental attitude of the people of the two countries.</p>

<p>A postal service modelled on that of Europe was
inaugurated in Japan in 1871 by the introduction of
a Government letter post between Tokio, Kyoto, Osaka,
and Yokohama. Arrangements had, of course, long previously
existed for the transmission of official correspondence
throughout the country, but private letters
were conveyed by private carriers. The following year
the official postal service was extended to the whole of
Japan, but not till twelve months later were private
carriers abolished and the post-office, with all its various
ramifications, constituted a State monopoly. Postcards,
embossed envelopes, newspaper wrappers, and all the
paraphernalia&mdash;so far as they had then been developed&mdash;of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
European post-offices were adopted by the Japanese
postal authorities, and caught on with the people with
surprising rapidity. In 1875 mail steamers were established
between Japan and the Chinese ports, and the next
year Japan, which at that time had, as I have elsewhere
mentioned, to view post-offices established in the treaty
ports, herself planted Japanese post-offices in both China
and Korea. The Postal Union was joined in 1877, and
from that time the Japanese post-office has developed,
<i>pari passu</i> with the post-offices of European countries
until at the present time it is in some respects ahead of
them in the matter of enterprise and the facilities it
affords. The Inland Parcel Post was established in 1892,
and it has had a marked effect in the opening up of the
country and the familiarising of the people with many
commodities, principally European, of which they had
previously no knowledge. At the present time there are
considerably over 6,000 post-offices. About a thousand
millions of letters and postcards&mdash;a favourite means of
communication&mdash;are handled yearly. The number of
parcels at present sent through the post amounts to
about eleven millions annually.</p>

<p>Every description of post-office business as known in
Europe is not only transacted in Japan, but, so far
as results go to show, each new phase seems to fill
a distinct want on the part of the people. Take the
matter of postal orders for example, the introduction
of which in this country was so vigorously opposed by
the banking community, but a facility which has proved
of incalculable utility and convenience to the mass of the
public. Postal orders, when introduced into Japan, quickly
came into favour. In the first year only a certain number
of offices were authorised to issue and to pay these orders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
This number has now been largely increased, and many
millions of postal orders are at present annually sold in
Japan. The International Postal Order Service has also
assumed considerable dimensions, and has largely aided,
I think, in the industrial and commercial development
of the country.</p>

<p>Post Office Savings Banks were established in Japan as
far back as 1875. The object, as in this country, was to
encourage thrift among the mass of the people. The
maximum deposit in one year of any depositor is limited
to 500 yen (about &pound;50). The Post Office Savings Bank
has been largely utilised, and both the number of
depositors and the sums deposited continue to grow on
a scale which shows that the utility and benefit of this
institution are greatly appreciated by the Japanese people.
At first the Savings Bank was worked at a loss; it took
time to develop, while in its infancy banking methods
were probably not as well understood by the Japanese
authorities as they now are. At the present time the Post
Office Savings Bank in Japan is so worked that it not only
pays all its expenses but returns a profit to the national
exchequer. In this respect it very favourably compares
with the Post Office Savings Bank as administered in this
country, which is not only worked at a loss, but, owing to
various causes, has entailed a liability, nominal though it
be, on the British taxpayer.</p>

<p>Telegraphs were first introduced into Japan in 1869,
and, as was the custom at that time in almost all countries,
the telegraph followed the railway. The first line was
between the capital and Yokohama. As time progressed
some steps were taken in the direction of developing the
system, but it was not until 1878 that the telegraph
service in Japan was placed on a proper footing. In 1879
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the International Telegraph Union was entered. At the
present time Japan is covered by a network of telegraph
wires, and every important island is in communication
with the capital. Telegrams may be sent either in the
Japanese or European languages. Like every other
means of communication, the telegraph has been rapidly
adopted by the Japanese people, and it now forms such
a part of the national life that it is almost impossible to
imagine the country without a telegraph system. There
are about 2,600 telegraph offices in Japan, and over twenty
million messages are annually despatched therefrom.
I think it will be admitted that&mdash;especially in view of
the difficulties occasioned by the necessity of the
operators in the telegraph offices being conversant to
some extent with the characteristics of two absolutely
different descriptions of languages&mdash;the progress made
by Japan, and the development and extension of the
telegraph service of the country, have been really
remarkable.</p>

<p>When the question of introducing telephones into Japan
came up for consideration it was treated somewhat more
practically than was the case with reference to a similar
matter in this country. There was there as here a
difference of opinion as to whether telephonic communication
should be left to private enterprise or be constituted
a Government monopoly. After somewhat prolonged
investigation it was decided that the telephone service
should be set up and worked by the Government, and in
the year 1890 the first telephone, that between Tokio and
Yokohama, was opened. At first, strange to say, this new
device of Western civilisation appears somewhat to have
hung fire, and no general demand sprung up for the
fitting of the telephone to private houses. It required, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
indeed was the case in this country, some education of the
people in regard to the paramount advantages of always
having this means of communication at hand. The
process of education in this respect was not prolonged.
Before the telephone had been many years in the country
the demand for its installation in houses and offices
became so great that the Government had to obtain a
special grant of money in order to carry out the necessary
work. According to the latest returns there are somewhere
about 350 telephone offices open to the public,
while the approximate number of messages transmitted
is about 150,000,000. The time is not far distant when,
as I think will also be the case in this country, the
telephone will be deemed to be an indispensable adjunct
of almost every house in the towns of Japan.</p>

<p>In connection with the means of communication one
or two remarks in reference to tramways may not be
out of place. These are entirely, or almost entirely,
electric, and have certainly, if we are to judge by the
patronage accorded to them, been very favourably
received by the Japanese people. According to the
latest returns I have available there were twenty-two
tramway companies in Japan, which between them, in
the year 1904, carried the very respectable total of over
73,000,000 passengers. All of these lines save one are
electric. The first electric tramway, that in Kyoto, was
opened in 1895, so that the development of the country
in this direction has proceeded rapidly. The Tokio
Electric Tramway Company pays a dividend of 11 per
cent., and although this is a record which some of
the other lines have not yet attained, and may not
possibly attain, nevertheless these matters must not
be altogether looked at from the point of view of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
dividends. The shareholder very probably regards them
from that standpoint, but I suggest that the facilities
given to a town may be as great or even greater by a
tramway paying 2, or 3, or 5 per cent. as by
one paying double that figure. Indeed, large dividends
are often earned by cutting down expenditure or abstaining
from expenditure designed to increase the facilities
of passengers. There is every prospect of electric tramways
being extended to every town of any importance
in Japan, and I am confident they will greatly aid in
the industrial development of the land.</p>

<p>I cannot leave a consideration of the means of
communication in Japan without making some reference
to that somewhat peculiar vehicle which is by so
many persons deemed to be essentially characteristic of
the country, although, as a matter of fact, I believe it
is of comparatively recent introduction, having been
introduced either by a European or an American; I
refer, of course, to the jinricksha. Before Japan became
to so great an extent the objective point of the globe-trotter,
and Europe, through the medium of numerous
books, was rendered conversant with everything relating
to the country, nothing more struck the imagination of
the new arrival in Japan than the sight of this extraordinary
vehicle&mdash;a kind of armchair on wheels with
two shafts, pulled by a man scantily clad and with
extremely muscular legs. Whoever was the individual
responsible for the invention of the jinricksha, he certainly
conferred a great boon on all foreigners resident in Japan
before railways and tramways and other means of communication
became as prevalent as they now are. The long
distances traversed by the man between the shafts of a
jinricksha and the speed he attained and maintained were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
almost a marvel to the foreign visitor. It was possible to
get about the country in one of these vehicles quite as fast
as any horse-drawn vehicle could convey one, and quite as
comfortably. I have heard it stated that the men who
pull these vehicles unduly develop their legs at the
expense of other portions of their body, and that the
speed at which they run and which they certainly keep up
for extraordinarily long periods has extremely injurious
effects on their constitution, so that they are, as a rule,
not long-lived. I am not aware, nor have I been able
to ascertain, whether such statements are mere theories or
have any foundation in fact. This much I will say, that the
Japanese jinricksha-runners are an extraordinary class in
reference to the speed which they attain dragging a goodly
weight for a very long distance. It does not seem likely
that the jinricksha, acclimatised as it has been in Japan,
will be ousted by other modern contrivances for getting
about the country. It is still very much in evidence,
and it is universally admitted by those who have had
experience of it to be a most comfortable means of
locomotion. Why it has never come into favour, at least
to any extent, elsewhere than in Japan I have never been
able to understand. Certainly jinrickshas can be hired at
Shanghai, and they are to be seen at one or two other
places in the Far East, but it may be regarded as a
distinctly Japanese vehicle, although, as I have said, there
is nothing Japanese about it excepting its adaptation in
the country.</p>

<p>I remarked at the commencement of this chapter that
we may properly gauge the progress of a nation by the
facilities it possesses or has developed for inter-communication
personally and otherwise. I hope the few remarks
I have made on this head may enable my readers to form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
some idea as to the position of Japan in this matter. I
have not wearied them with statistics, but I have, I think,
said enough to show that in everything relating to
communication, whether it be the locomotion of the
individual or the facilities given to him to communicate
his wishes, desires, aspirations, sentiments, Japan is now
well in line with all the other great civilised Powers, and
has reason to be proud of the progress she has made and
the manner in which she has adapted to the requirements
of her people the ideas and inventions she has obtained
from Europe and America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>LAW AND ORDER</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N every nation which aspires to be regarded as civilised
the supremacy of the law and the maintenance of
order are matters of supreme importance. The most
perfect code of law ever devised is quite evidently of no
importance unless adequate means exist for enforcing its
provisions, and although justice may be lauded as a most
admirable object of attainment, yet, unless the courts of
the country are independent, hold the scales evenly and
use the sword with impartiality, justice will remain merely
a sentiment, and there will be no practical exemplification
of it. I have considered in this book as tersely as possible
most of the factors of civilisation in Japan. Let me
briefly deal with this matter of law and order.</p>

<p>When the Revolution was effected in 1868 the whole
legal procedure of the country was thrown more or less
into a condition of disorganisation. Prior to 1868, as my
readers will have seen, feudal principles prevailed in Japan.
The feudal lords, or Daimios, administered justice, or what
passed for it, within their own territories, and they were
answerable to the central authority. In theory the feudal
lords were commissioners of the ruling sovereign from
whom they derived their authority; in practice they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
very largely a law unto themselves, and their subjects had
little or no practical chance of redress in the event of their
suffering any injustice. It is very difficult to ascertain
whether there was in reality a legal code of any kind in
existence and under the ken of these feudal lords. The legal
system then in vogue appears to have been based for the
most part on custom and usage. A writer on the subject
has remarked that the few written laws were of a
thoroughly practical character. Unfortunately I have
not had an opportunity of acquainting myself with the
nature of these laws. They were probably, like everything
else in the country, imported from China, and
indeed the Chinese legal system has been supreme in
Japan until recently, and even now I am not quite certain
that much of its influence does not remain. I have read
that the fundamental principle underlying the written
laws referred to was that: &ldquo;The people should obey
the law, but should not know the law.&rdquo; The code was
accordingly a secret one. I have not space, nor indeed
have I any inclination, to deal with what is, after all,
an academical question as to the law prevalent in Japan
prior to the Revolution. It was probably for the most
part, just as in other countries when feudalism existed,
a kind of rough-and-ready justice, which perhaps
served its purpose well at the time, and depended more
as regards the matter of justice upon the administrator
of it than upon the code itself. Though the
Revolution took place in 1868, it was not until 1871 that
the Daimios were deprived of all their administrative
authority. The whole of the country was then divided
into districts under the control of the central Government,
and all relics of feudalism and class privileges, which had
been numerous, were ruthlessly swept away. In due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
course a civil code, commercial code, code of civil
procedure, and code of criminal procedure were issued.
One or two of these codes were found not to work well in
practice, and they have been submitted to and revised by
committees specially appointed for that purpose.</p>

<p>As I stated in the chapter on the Constitution the
independence of the judges is recognised and provided for.
The legal system of Japan at the present time is eclectic.
As I have said, the Chinese system of legal procedure long
obtained, and its influences may perhaps to some extent
still remain. Nevertheless Japan has gone to various
countries and selected what she deemed good in each for
her present legal system. The jurisprudence of both
France and England have been largely drawn on. In
reference to the civil law custom is, as might have been
expected in view of the circumstances of the country, still
strongly relied on. There has often been a difficulty in
ascertaining custom owing to the changed and changing
conditions of the nation, and in reference thereto very
much the same procedure has followed as in this country
where the question of custom is so frequently pleaded in
the courts of law. Some of the German system of
jurisprudence has also been included in the Japanese legal
system. As I have elsewhere observed, the suggestion
to abolish extra-territoriality, and with it the foreign
courts in Japan, met with a considerable amount of
opposition from the foreign community there who believed
that they would not be able to obtain justice in the
Japanese courts. These fears have been shown to be
groundless, and it is now generally recognised that the
foreigner in Japan need have no fear of going into a
Japanese court where he is, whether it be a civil or
criminal matter, certain to obtain a perfectly fair trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Closely connected with law is the matter of police. In
Japan the police of the country are entirely under the
control of the State, just as are the constabulary in Ireland.
The police are under the orders of the Minister of the
Interior, who has a special office for dealing with the matter.
The cost of the force is, however, paid by each prefecture,
the State granting a small subsidy. According to the
latest statistics, the police force of Japan amounted to
something under 35,000 officers and men. When we consider
that this body of men is responsible for the enforcement
of the law and the preservation of order among some
47,000,000 people, it will, I think, be admitted that the
number is not excessive. The social condition of the
Japanese police, if I may use such a term, is higher than
that of the police in this and other countries. In Japan
the police force had its genesis after the abolition of
feudalism, and, as a matter of fact, a large proportion of
the first members thereof belonged to the Samurai class.
The social position and intellectual attainment of these
young men gave what I may term a standing to the
police force in Japan which it has not yet lost. Of course,
nothing like the same class of men is now attracted to it,
the salaries are comparatively small and the work is not
over-congenial for people whose ideas are such as those of
the Japanese.</p>

<p>I may mention, as an interesting feature in this connection,
that the Government have established a police and
prison college in Tokio, where both police and prison
officials are effectively trained for the discharge of their
duties. This college was established when extra-territoriality
was abolished, with the view of ensuring a higher
training in view of the additional responsibilities that
would devolve upon the police and prison officials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
From police I naturally come to some consideration of
prisons. There are a large number of people in this
country who have the idea in their mind that prisons are
a weak point in all foreign countries, and that it is only in
England that these regrettable institutions are properly
managed. In fact the idea now seems to be prevalent
here that we have gone too far in the direction of making
prisons comfortable, and that excellent alliteration
&ldquo;Coddled Criminals&rdquo; has more than once done duty in
print in this connection. I consider that the present
prison system in Japan is regulated and administered on
sounder principles than those that obtain in this country.
There are in all about 140 prisons in Japan. All the old
prisons in the country were constructed of wood and
arranged on the associate system. A separate cell system
is, however, specially provided for foreign criminals, who
are given clothes, bedding, and other articles to which they
are used. The Government, a few years ago, commenced
the construction of a number of new prisons, for the most
part built of brick, in which a mixed system of separation
and association, according to the offences of the prisoners,
will be employed. The windows of these prisons were
directed to be made especially large, so that the prisoners
might have plenty of light and air. This is a matter in
which some foreign Governments, that of this country
included, might well take a lesson from Japan.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to be able to state that since 1899 the
inmates of the prisons have been decreasing in number.
There is nothing quite analogous to the ticket-of-leave
system in this country. Parole is suggested by a prison
governor to the Minister of Justice in reference to any
prisoner whom he may deem worthy of the privilege,
provided that prisoner has completed three-fourths of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sentence imposed upon him and has shown a disposition
to live more worthily. I do not quite know how this
latter fact is made plain in gaol, but at any rate the
prison governor has to be convinced of it. A prisoner
thus released remains under police supervision during
the remainder of his sentence.</p>

<p>In Japan the death penalty is not confined to murder.
It may be inflicted for robbery with violence, homicide,
wounds inflicted by children upon their fathers,
mothers, and grand-parents, as well as for arson. This
sounds a somewhat drastic blood code, but when I state
that the average number of persons executed in Japan
does not exceed thirty a year, it will be seen that either
the crimes mentioned are infrequent or that the punishment
of death is only inflicted in extreme cases.</p>

<p>One interesting feature of the Japanese prison system is
the granting of medals to criminals who have shown an
amendment of their lives by good conduct and diligence
at their work. The privileges enjoyed by persons possessing
these medals are so interesting that I will transcribe
them here:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. All medallists are supplied with superior kinds of
garments and other articles.</p>

<p>2. Each medallist is allowed to send out two letters
per month.</p>

<p>3. Medallists enjoy the privilege of bathing prior to
other prisoners, hot water being used in accordance with
the general custom of the Japanese people.</p>

<p>4. The supply of accessories is increased in quantity
every week for medallists, according to the number of
medals granted, to the extent of an increased expense of
two sen or less for one meal per person. This increase
is granted once a week to the possessor of two medals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and three times a week for each possessor of three
medals.</p>

<p>5. The allotment of earnings is made in the following
proportion, the remainder being applied to prison expenses:&mdash;</p>

<p>Three-tenths to each felon to whom one medal has been
granted.</p>

<p>Four-tenths to each misdemeanant to whom one medal
has been awarded.</p>

<p>Four-tenths to each felon having been granted two
medals.</p>

<p>Five-tenths to each felon possessing three medals.</p>

<p>Six-tenths to each misdemeanant granted three medals.</p>

<p>There is no need for me to deal with the question
of punishment of criminals in Japanese prisons. I may,
however, remark that in respect of foreign criminals every
effort is made to treat them in accordance with their
conditions of national life in regard to bathing, food, &amp;c.
In reference to the question of prison labour, which has
become somewhat of a vexed economic problem in this
country, the Japanese authorities do not appear to
experience much difficulty. The object of the prison
system of labour is to give the prisoners a careful training,
and to encourage diligence, so that on their return to the
world they may not experience difficulty in obtaining
employment. The labour is of two kinds&mdash;Government,
and for private individuals. In the latter case the necessary
labour is obtained from the prisons direct, the
employers supplying the material. I think this part of
the system is perhaps open to question, as it has been
found in other countries productive of grave abuses.</p>

<p>The discharged prisoner in Japan, as in other countries,
finds a difficulty in obtaining employment, and several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
societies similar to those in existence here have been
established with a view of assisting discharged prisoners.
I have not sufficient information to enable me to say
what measure of success these societies have achieved.
In a country like Japan, which is endeavouring to perfect
all her institutions, I hope that the discharged prisoner
problem will be solved otherwise than by philanthropic
societies. The criminal who has completed his sentence
ought to be deemed to have purged his offence, and has
a right to return to the community and obtain work until,
if ever, he again misconducts himself.</p>

<p>I hope my few remarks on the subject of the means
taken in Japan to maintain law and order will tend to
convince my readers that in every detail of her administration
Japan has shown a capacity for adapting what is
good in foreign nations and moulding it for her own
purposes. The foreign community in Japan has long
since got over its state of panic in regard to the danger of
suing and being sued in Japanese courts, and the possibility
of being an inmate of a Japanese gaol. The years that
have elapsed since the treaties were revised have demonstrated
clearly that, if anything, extra consideration is
shown to the foreigner in all the details of the administration
of the law in Japan. I remarked at the beginning
of this chapter that the supremacy of the law and the
maintenance of order are matters of supreme importance
in every civilised country. Japan has recognised this fact,
and she has acted upon the recognition thereof with most
admirable results.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>LITERATURE AND THE DRAMA</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE literature of Japan is a somewhat recondite
subject, while the Japanese drama is at present, like
many other things in the country, to a great extent in a
state of transition. Still, some remarks on these two
matters are, I consider, absolutely essential in order that
my readers may form some idea of two important phases
of Japanese life. The literature of Japan is indeed largely
mixed up with the national life through many centuries&mdash;a
reflection, in fact, of it. The late Sir Edwin Arnold, whose
great authority on everything connected with Japan is
generally admitted, has observed in reference to the
literature of that country: &ldquo;The time will come when
Japan, safe, famous, and glad with the promise of peaceful
years to follow and to reward this present period of life
and death conflict, will engage once again the attraction
of the Western nations on the side of her artistic and
intellectual gifts. Already in this part of the globe
persons of culture have become well aware how high and
subtle is her artistic genius; and by and by it will be
discovered that there are real treasures to be found in her
literature. Moreover, England, beyond any other European
country, is likely to be attracted to this branch, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
present naturally neglected, of what may be called the
spiritual side of Japanese life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The drawback to the fulfilment of the somewhat optimistic
forecast of Sir Edwin Arnold is the great difficulty
experienced by the Western nations in acquiring a
sufficient knowledge of the language in which the treasures
of Japanese literature are embedded if not entombed. No
man can ever grasp the beauties of a literature, and
especially an Oriental literature, through the medium of
a translation, however well done. A translation is like a
diamond with the brilliancy removed, if we can imagine
such a thing. It may be faultlessly correct in its rendering,
and yet absolutely misleading in its interpretation of
the original.</p>

<p>Japanese literature embraces poetry, history, fiction,
books of ceremony and travel, as well as many works
of an ethical nature. Poetry is supposed to have reached
its most brilliant period in Japan a long way back&mdash;long
even before Geoffrey Chaucer took up his pen to write
those immortal lines which I fear but comparatively few
Englishmen now read. In reference to this poetry of
twelve hundred years ago, Mr. Aston&mdash;perhaps the
greatest authority on the subject&mdash;remarks: &ldquo;While the
eighth century has left us little or no prose literature of
importance, it was emphatically the golden age of poetry.
Japan has now outgrown the artless effusions described
in the preceding chapter, and during this period produced
a body of verse of an excellence which has never since
been surpassed. The reader who expects to find this
poetry of a nation just emerging from the barbaric stage
of culture characterised by rude, untutored vigour, will be
surprised to learn that, on the contrary, it is distinguished
by polish rather than power. It is delicate in sentiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and refined in language, and displays exquisite skill of
phrase with a careful adherence to certain canons of
composition of its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess my knowledge of the language is insufficient
to enable me to read Japan&rsquo;s literary treasures in the
original, and as I have remarked, no man through the
medium of a translation can adequately form a correct
opinion respecting any description of foreign literature.
I fear, however, that modern Japan is as little concerned
with its eighth-century poetry as the modern Englishman
is with that of Chaucer, not to speak of those great poets,
most of whom are now forgotten, who lived long before
Chaucer and whose verses were not only read but sung
throughout the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>In a much later period of the history of the country,
literature was undoubtedly greatly in vogue. There was
evolved what I may term a distinct literary class, the
language and literature of China were diligently studied,
and very much of the literature of this time is written
in Chinese. That language, indeed, seems to have been
at one period regarded in Japan very much as Latin
was, and in some quarters is even still, regarded in Europe
as the appropriate medium for expressing the most sublime
thoughts of the brightest intellects. The fiction of this
period, usually termed the Heian&mdash;and there is plenty of
it still in existence&mdash;was for the most part written by
women, so that it will be seen the female novelist is not,
as some persons appear to imagine, a comparatively
modern development. After the twelfth century&mdash;and
most of the literature I have referred to is anterior to that&mdash;petty
wars between the feudal princes appear to have
been incessant, and the whole country was for a great
number of years more concerned with fighting than with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
literature. History or historical romance seems to have
been the favourite literary exercitation during this period.
A good deal of the literature thereof is still, I understand,
read in Japan, especially by its youth, for whom the
stirring episodes embodied in the history and historical
romances of these bellicose times seem to have an especial
fascination.</p>

<p>The Tokugawa period, covering the 270 years during
which the Government of the Tycoon was installed in
Yeddo, was one during which literature made great
progress in Japan. Those years were a time of profound
peace; the country was cut off from the rest of the world,
thrown in upon itself, and accordingly had ample leisure,
and possibly much inclination, to develop its artistic side,
especially in literature. The study of books was prevalent
everywhere, and quite a band of teachers arose in the land
whose mission it was to expound its ancient literature, and
exhume for public edification and delectation many of the
buried literary treasures of the past. These teachers were
not content with mere oral description; they wrote what
would now be termed treatises or commentaries, many of
which show great depth of learning, by way of expounding
and explaining the classics of Japan with a view of
bringing them within the ken of the great mass of the
people. This period (the Tokugawa) also had its works
of fiction; it produced many dramas and, I believe, some,
if not much, poetry. The romances of this time are, I am
told, written principally for or down to the level of the
common people. The classics of Japan were, and probably
still are, like the classics of Greece and Rome in respect of
the mass of the people of this country, not understood,
and most likely were they, would not be appreciated.
And hence in the Tokugawa period what I may term
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the popular writer was evolved, and he turned out, under
a <i>nom-de-plume</i> for the most part, books for the lower
orders. These works are now regarded as somewhat
vulgar, but they are in many respects a mirror of the
age in which they were written, and it is doubtful if they
are much coarser in style than some of the novels
published in England in the eighteenth century. Vulgarity,
it must be remembered, is largely a matter of opinion,
and because either the Japanese of to-day or the foreigner
who has perused, perhaps in a translation, this fiction of
a couple of centuries back, dubs it according to the
opinion of to-day vulgar, it by no means follows that it
was so considered in Japan two hundred years back.</p>

<p>Since the Revolution of 1868 it is doubtful if Japan has
produced any distinctive literature. The whole country
and all the national modes of thought have been in a state
of transition, a condition of unrest&mdash;circumstances not
conducive to the production of classical literature; moreover,
literary ideas and conceptions have changed and are
still changing&mdash;changing rapidly. The development of a
powerful newspaper press must have a marked and far-reaching
effect on Japanese literature. So also must the
study of Western literature by the educated classes&mdash;a
study which is both extensive and increasing. Japanese
literature is now undoubtedly in the melting-pot, so to
speak, and what will be the precise result it is impossible
to determine. It must be confessed that the modern
Japanese who has been educated according to Western
methods, and is adequately acquainted with the languages
and literature of Europe, is infrequently an admirer of the
peculiar literature of his own country. Possibly it suffers
by comparison. Japan has produced no Dante, or Shakespeare,
or Milton. The moods of her people, and probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the limitations and peculiarities of the language, have
prevented the possibility of the appearance of such divine
geniuses. There is, its critics declare, an absence of
sustained power and sublimity in Japanese literature
generally, while the didactic and philosophical, if not
altogether lacking, is extremely rare therein. But it
seems to me the height of absurdity to compare the
literature of a country like Japan with the literature of
some other land where everything is, and always has
been, essentially different. To properly comprehend, and
probably to be able to appreciate Japanese literature, it
would be necessary to get, so to speak, into the atmosphere
in which it was produced. To judge it by twentieth-century
standards and canons of criticism and from
European standpoints is not only unfair but must create
a totally false impression.</p>

is still imperfect, the drama has played an important part,
and Japan has been no exception to the rule. Its dramatic
literature is, I believe, of considerable extent, and to
understand, much less appreciate it properly would require
very profound study. Many of the more or less ancient
dramas are works not only containing the dialogue of
the play but much descriptive matter. They were, as a
matter of fact, written for theatres in which there were
to be not actors but marionettes, singers being engaged
to sing the lines out of sight while the puppets depicted
the characters. Some of these dramas have, since they
were written, been adapted for the ordinary stage and the
characters portrayed by Japan&rsquo;s most famous actors. The
theatre was long looked down upon and it is only of
comparatively recent years that it has been looking up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
A large number of persons in this country still appear to
be under the impression that there are no actresses on the
Japanese stage. This is, of course, a mistake, caused no
doubt by the fact that in Japanese theatres the female
characters in a play are so often impersonated by men.
Some two or three centuries back actors and actresses
used, as in Europe, to play in the same piece, but this was
for some reason or other interdicted, and ever since there
have been companies composed of men and women
respectively. In the male companies some of the female
parts naturally fell to men and in the female companies
the male parts were of necessity depicted by women. Of
recent years the tendency is to revert to the ancient
practice and to come into line with the custom of
European countries in this matter, and ere long, no doubt
in Japanese theatres the female characters will be taken
by women and the male characters by men.</p>

<p>The theatre has always been a popular institution in
Japan, and the pieces usually played have very much
the same <i>motif</i> as the dramas formerly so popular in this
country&mdash;the discomfiture of the villain and the triumph
of virtue. The Japanese theatre does not appeal to the
ordinary European visitor, or indeed to many Europeans
living in the country. In the first place, the performance
is too long for the European taste, and in the next, most
Japanese plays are of one kind, and concerned with one
period&mdash;the feudal. There is, moreover, a plethora of
by-play&mdash;sword exercise and acrobatic performances&mdash;which
have nothing whatever to do with the plot of the
piece. In fact, irrelevancy appears to the European the
chief characteristic of what he sees on the stage of a
Japanese theatre. Nor does the play, as is usual in
serious dramas in this country, revolve round one character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the hero or heroine. Indeed it is not always easy to
earmark, so to speak, the leading character, and it is
occasionally doubtful in many Japanese plays whether
there is any hero or heroine. But the same remark may
be made here as in reference to the literature of the
country. It is probably essential to get into the Japanese
atmosphere in order to properly appreciate a Japanese
play. The drama in Japan at any rate serves, and so
far as I have had an opportunity of forming an opinion
in the matter, serves well, its purpose to interest and
amuse the frequenters of the theatres, besides which the
lessons it inculcates are for the most part of a moral
nature.</p>

<p>The high art of the Japanese theatre is represented by
the &ldquo;N&ocirc;,&rdquo; which I suppose fills much the same position
as does the Italian opera in this country. The &ldquo;N&ocirc;&rdquo;
is, I believe, very ancient. The written text is sung;
there is a principal and a secondary character and a
chorus. The dialogue is as ancient, some critics say as
archaic, as the time in which the play was written, and
I understand it requires being educated up to it in order
to fully appreciate the &ldquo;N&ocirc;.&rdquo; The ordinary Japanese
would probably just as much fail to comprehend or like
it as would the Englishman from Mile End, were he
taken to Covent Garden, and invited to go into raptures
over one of Mozart&rsquo;s or Meyerbeer&rsquo;s masterpieces. A
performance of the &ldquo;N&ocirc;&rdquo; would probably interest those
who find excitement in a representation of &ldquo;&OElig;dipus
Tyrannus,&rdquo; or some Greek play. Still, the &ldquo;N&ocirc;&rdquo; is
appreciated by a large number of the intellectual classes
in Japan, who find an interest in the representation of
this Japanese opera, as I suppose it may be termed.</p>

<p>As I have already said, very much the same remarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
made in reference to the literature of Japan apply to its
drama. That country is still in the transition stage,
and both its drama and its literature will undoubtedly
be profoundly modified in future years. Western literature
and Western dramatic art have already exercised
considerable influence, and there are movements on foot
whose object is to replace the old ideas and methods,
especially in the matter of the representation of dramatic
works by those which obtain in Europe and America.
Whether these movements will be successful or not
remains to be seen. There is certainly a large body of
public opinion not only opposed but antagonistic to them.
In spite of the rapid development of Japan in recent years,
there is a very strong conservative party in the country&mdash;a
party which, though it recognises or acquiesces in the
desirability of change in many directions, is not prepared
to throw overboard everything because it is old. I sincerely
hope that the distinctive literature and dramatic
art of the country will not be allowed to die out. Japan
cannot afford to forget the past with its influences on
the national life and character, influences at work for
many ages which have assuredly had a material effect
in elevating her to the position she at present occupies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>NEWSPAPERS IN JAPAN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>APAN having taken on most of the characteristics and
some of the idiosyncracies of Western civilisation,
has naturally developed a newspaper press of its own.
Of course newspapers in Japan are no new thing. Mr.
Kumoto, editor of the <i>Japan Times</i>, claims for Japanese
journalism an origin as far back as the early part of the
seventeenth century. &ldquo;Long before,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;our
doors of seclusion were forced open by the impatient
nations of the West, our ancestors had found a device
by which they kept themselves in touch with current
events and news. The news-sheets of those days were
roughly got up, being printed from wooden blocks hastily
purchased for each issue. They were meagre in news,
uncouth in form, and quite irregular in appearance, there
being no fixed date for publication. Neither were they
issued by any particular and fixed publisher. Anybody
could issue them, and at any time they pleased. These
sheets were called Yomuri, which, being translated, means
&lsquo;sold by hawking.&rsquo;&rdquo; These ancient newspapers had,
however, palpably nothing in common with modern
journalism, and anything in the shape of criticism or
comment, or any attempt to guide or mould public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
opinion was, of course, not to be found therein. He would
have been a bold man at the beginning of the seventeenth
century, or indeed very much later, who would have
ventured to print and publish anything tending to influence
public opinion, or having the appearance of being
a criticism on those in authority.</p>

<p>We may take it that for all practical purposes the rise
of the native newspaper press of Japan did not take place
till some time after the Revolution of 1868. If its rise
has been recent its progress has certainly been rapid.
There can be no question that both the rise and development
of the vernacular press has been largely influenced
by English journalism. There have always, since the
opening of the country, been English newspapers in
Japan, and very admirable newspapers too. One or more
Englishmen have started papers printed in Japanese, and
although these ventures were not commercially successful,
they, at any rate, showed the way for Japanese journalism.
Mr. Kumoto in his very interesting remarks published in
Stead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Japan and the Japanese,&rdquo; gives an amusing
illustration of the somewhat amateur business lines on
which the native Japanese newspapers were at first produced.
He quotes the following notice which appeared
in one of them: &ldquo;The editors note with satisfaction the
growing prosperity of their venture, and notify their subscribers
that in view of the increased labour and trouble
entailed on them by their increasing circulation, the
gracious subscribers will kindly spare them the trouble by
sending for their copies instead of having them delivered
to them as before.&rdquo; There has certainly been a remarkable
development in the Japanese newspaper press since this
somewhat jejune announcement was published. Tokio
at the present time possesses about forty daily newspapers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and there is hardly a town in the country of any importance
that has not one or two papers of its own. There
are now more than a thousand magazines and newspapers
of various kinds published in the country&mdash;a number which
yearly increases, and is certain to increase in the near
future to a very much greater extent.</p>

<p>But besides newspapers, Japan possesses news agencies
on somewhat similar lines to those that exist in this
country, whose function it is to supply the press with
the latest news on every matter of public and, I am afraid,
sometimes of merely private importance. Whether these
news agencies perform useful functions either in this
country or in Japan, is a matter upon which I shall
express no opinion. News acquired in a hurry in competition
with other agencies which exist for a similar
purpose, and purveyed to journals printed in a hurry and
read in a hurry, does not often allow of discrimination
being exercised in regard to its circulation. The sensational
element in the native press in Japan is quite as
much in evidence as in that of this country. In regard
to this kind of literary fare, the appetite increases with
feeding, if I may vary an old French proverb, and the
sensational journals of the Japanese capital are increasing
in demand from every part of the country.</p>

<p>As to the part which the press of Japan exercises in
moulding public opinion, I confess I have not formed any
clear idea; indeed, it is one upon which it is difficult to
come to any conclusion. How far the press there moulds,
and how far it follows public opinion is somewhat problematical.
Be that as it may, many of the native papers
are vigorously and effectively written, and indeed many
eminent men in Japan have been either directly or indirectly
connected with the press. The newspapers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Japan differ in this respect from those of this country&mdash;that
there is a press law there, and newspapers are in
theory, at any rate, somewhat more hampered in their
criticisms and the publication of news than is the case
here. This press law seems to have irritated the English
more than the vernacular press of Japan, especially during
the late war. Under the provisions of the law, a warning
is always given to an offending newspaper before any
official action is taken. The English journals in Japan
have, perhaps not unnaturally, not so far been able to
divest themselves of the idea that they have still extra-territorial
rights, and are consequently justified in publishing
any criticisms or news irrespective of the provisions of
the press law.</p>

<p>Newspapers in Japan do not of course attain such large
circulations as some of those in England. I do not
think there is any paper in the country with a circulation
exceeding 100,000, and there are only one or two which
reach anything like that figure. Advertising in Japan
in papers has not attained the same importance as in
this country. Of course all the journals, whether daily
or weekly, have a large number of advertisements, but
the non-advertisement portion of the paper forms a greater
portion of the whole than is the case here. It may
interest some of my readers to know that poetry which
has long been tabooed by the press of this country is still
a feature in that of Japan, and that the novel &ldquo;to be
continued in our next,&rdquo; is also served up for the delectation
of Japanese readers.</p>

<p>A free press in a free country is no doubt an admirable
institution, but it has its disadvantages. I need not
enumerate them, as my readers probably know them
as well as I do myself. Indeed, both in England and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
America of late years we have had plenty of object-lessons,
were any needed, in regard to these disadvantages.
&ldquo;The yellow press&rdquo; is a phrase which has now come
into general use to denote the certain kind of journalism
which lives and thrives by pandering to the desire that
so many persons in this world have for morbid sensationalism
and the publication of nauseating and shocking
details. People who have appetites of this kind are in
need of having them perennially gratified, and accordingly
it naturally comes about that the conductors of journals
such as I have referred to, if they cannot provide a
sufficient quantity of sensationalism true or partly true,
have either to invent it or exaggerate some perhaps
innocent or innocuous incident. I am sorry to say
that yellow journalism is not only not unknown in Japan,
but is apparently in a very flourishing condition there.
I regret the fact all the more because the people of Japan
are not yet sufficiently educated or enlightened to receive
what they read in the newspaper in a sceptical spirit.
That educational and enlightening process is only effected
by a long course of newspaper reading. Even in this
country we can remember the time when any statement
was implicitly believed because it was &ldquo;in the papers.&rdquo;
Now some other and better evidence of the truth of
any report is needed than the publication thereof in a
newspaper. Young Japan will no doubt ere long
assimilate this fact, and when it does the yellow press
of Japan will probably find its <i>client&eacute;le</i> a diminishing
quantity. I hope my readers will not deduce from
these remarks that I entertain, on the whole, a poor opinion
of the native press of Japan. Considering the difficulties
it has had to contend with, I consider that the
progress it has made during the comparatively few years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it has been in existence is as wonderful as anything
in the country. And I am furthermore of opinion that
the influence it exercises is, on the whole, a healthy one. It
has done a great work in the education of the mass of
the Japanese people in the direction of taking a broader
view of life and teaching them that there is a world
outside their own particular locality and beyond their own
country. And while referring to the newspaper press I
may also give a meed of praise to the large number
of journals and magazines of a literary, scientific, and
religious nature. The effect of these ably conducted
periodicals as an educational influence must be immense.
The number of them is gradually growing, and the support
rendered to them serves to show, were any proof needed,
how profoundly interested the Japan of to-day is in
all those questions, whether political, scientific, religious, or
literary, which are not the possession of or the subject
of discussion among any particular nation but are
exercising the minds and consciences of the civilised
world.</p>

<p>One pleasing feature of the native press of Japan I
cannot help referring to, and that is the friendly sentiments
which it almost invariably expresses in regard to Great
Britain. As I have before remarked, it was this country
which in some degree influenced at first the Japanese press.
I am pleased that of late at any rate, since the somewhat
heated agitation in reference to the revision of the treaties
has come to an end, its tone has been almost universally
friendly to this country, and its approval of the alliance
between Japan and Great Britain was not only unanimous
but enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The English newspapers in Japan are still, as they have
always been, ably conducted journals. Captain Brinkley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the editor of one of them, is a great authority on everything
connected with Japan, and the paper he edits is
worthy of all that is best in English journalism. At
the same time it is hardly necessary to remark that the
English press in Japan exercises little or no influence
outside the immediate circle it represents. It very
naturally looks at everything, or almost everything, not
from the point of view of the Japanese but from that
of the foreigner in Japan. It may be truthfully averred
of the foreign press that, considered as a whole, it has never
done anything or attempted to do anything to break down
the barriers caused by racial differences. The European
press in Japan has in tone always been distinctly anti-Japanese,
and the sentiments which it has expressed
and the vigorous, not to say violent, language in which
those sentiments have been expressed has undoubtedly
in the past occasioned much bitterness of feeling among
the Japanese people or that portion of it which either read
or heard of those sentiments. The characteristics or
idiosyncracies of the people of Japan were either
exaggerated or misrepresented, and there were not
unnaturally reprisals quite as vigorous in the native
newspapers. During the war with China, for example,
the attitude of the European press was exasperating
to a degree&mdash;that is, exasperating to the Japanese people.
There were journals which avowedly took the part of
China and expressed a desire for China&rsquo;s success. The
victories of Japan in the course of the war were sneered
at and at first belittled. Subsequently, when the success
of Japan was self-evident, it was suggested by some of
these newspapers that she was suffering from swelled head
and was in need of being put in her place and kept there.
And, accordingly, when certain of the European Powers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
stepped in and deprived Japan of the fruits of her victories,
the action of those Powers was applauded, and the
undoubted sympathy of the English people in England
with Japan in the matter was derided by English editors
in Japan as mere maudlin sentimentality. Language
of this kind occasioned deep resentment among the people
of the country. The foreign press is now, I am glad
to say, saner, inasmuch as it to some extent recognises
facts and the trend of events, but I fear it even still is
for the most part representative of a community which
regards the Japanese from the standpoint that most
Europeans in the Far East regard the Eastern races
with whom they are brought in contact. The position of
the English papers in Japan has, I should say, been
considerably affected of recent years by the development
of the vernacular press. Twenty-five years or so ago they
were practically the only organs that voiced public
opinion of any kind in the country. Now they only
voice the opinion of a section of the foreign community.
A reference to a quarter of a century ago brings up
memories of a gentleman connected to some extent with
the newspaper press in Japan of those days. I refer to the
late Mr. Wergman, who owned and edited and filled&mdash;I
am not quite certain he did not print&mdash;that somewhat
extraordinary journal, the Yokohama <i>Punch</i>. It
appeared at uncertain intervals, and it dealt both in
print and illustration with various members of the foreign
community in Yokohama and its neighbourhood with a
vigour and freedom, not to say licence, which would
now hardly be tolerated. Its proprietor is long since dead,
and so I believe is the journal which he owned and whose
fitful appearances used to create such a mild excitement
among the foreign community in Yokohama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The functions of the press as a mirror of the times,
as a censor of men and things, and as a guide and a leader
of public opinion are of considerable importance. As
I have before remarked the press of Japan is at present
if not in its infancy at any rate in its youth. It is
accordingly ebullient, energetic, optimistic. Time will no
doubt correct many of its failings. Be that as it may,
I certainly am of opinion that, considering everything,
it has attained a wonderful degree of development, that
it has reached a position of great importance in the
country as an educational and enlightening influence, and
that all who wish well to Japan may look upon its
future with hope. It will no doubt play an important part
as the years roll by in the development of the country and
in the holding up before the people of worthy ideals in
reference to economic conditions, material progress, and
the conservation of the prestige and security of the
Japanese Empire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>JAPANESE MORALITY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Preface I remarked that Japanese morality was a
thorny subject. I use the word morality in its now
generally accepted rather than in its absolutely correct
meaning. Morality, strictly speaking, is the practice of
moral duties apart from religion or doctrine; it treats of
actions as being right or wrong&mdash;is, in brief, ethics. The
old &ldquo;morality&rdquo; play, for example, was not, as some people
seem to suppose, especially concerned with the relations of
the sexes; it was a drama in which allegorical representations
of all the virtues and vices were introduced as
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>. However, words, like everything else
in this world, change their meaning, and, though the
dictionary interpretation of morality is, as I have stated it,
colloquially at any rate, the word has now come for the
most part to signify sexual conduct, and it is in that sense,
as I have said, I use it.</p>

<p>The subject of the morality of the Japanese is one that
has been much discussed for many years past, and accordingly
is one in regard to which it may be urged that there
is little or nothing more to be said. I am not of that
opinion. In the first place, much of the discussion has
been simply the mere assertions of men, or sometimes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
women, who either did not have the opportunity, or else
had not the inclination, to investigate matters for themselves,
and were therefore largely dependent on the hearsay
evidence of not always unprejudiced persons. Or they
sometimes jumped to very pronounced and erroneous
conclusions from extremely imperfect observation or
information. Let me take as an example in point, a lady,
now dead, who wrote many charming books of travel&mdash;the
late Mrs. Bishop, better known as Miss Bird. In her
journeyings through the country Miss Bird relates in
&ldquo;Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,&rdquo; that she passed through a
wide street in which the houses were large and handsome
and open in front. Their highly polished floors and
passages, she remarks, looked like still water, the kakemonos,
or wall pictures, on their side-walls were extremely
beautiful, and their mats were very fine and white. There
were large gardens at the back with fountains and flowers,
and streams, crossed by light stone bridges, sometimes
flowed through the houses. The lady, who was on the
look-out for a resting-place, not unnaturally expressed a
desire to put up at one of these delightful sylvan retreats,
but her native attendant informed her that was impossible,
as they were kashitsukeyas, or tea-houses of a disreputable
character. Miss Bird, on the strength of this information,
thought it incumbent upon herself to pronounce
the somewhat sweeping judgment that &ldquo;there is much
even on the surface to indicate vices which degrade and
enslave the manhood of Japan.&rdquo; Such a statement is, of
course, the merest clap-trap, but even were it true, it
might be permissible to remark that if vice exists it is
surely better for it to be on than beneath the surface.
Such vice as does exist in Japan is, in my opinion, distinctly
on the surface, and I have no hesitation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
describing the morals of the Japanese people to be, on the
whole, greatly superior to those of Western nations.</p>

<p>There can, I think, be no question that a large number
of European people have formed their estimate of Japanese
women either from a visit to a comic opera such as &ldquo;The
Geisha,&rdquo; or from a perusal of a book like Pierre Loti&rsquo;s
fascinating work, &ldquo;Madame Chrysanth&eacute;me.&rdquo; This is in
effect the story of a <i>liaison</i> between a man and a Japanese
girl of the lower classes, with, of course, a large amount of
local colouring, and rendered generally charming by the
writer&rsquo;s brilliant literary style. Unfortunately, that large
number of Europeans who have never visited Japan have
taken the French academician&rsquo;s study of a girl of a certain
class as a life picture of the typical Japanese woman who
is, accordingly, deemed to be more or less, to use an
accepted euphemism, a person of easy virtue. Nothing
could, of course, be more erroneous, no conclusion further
from the truth. The remarks of Mr. Arthur Diosy in his
book, &ldquo;The New Far East,&rdquo; on this head are so much to
the point in reference to the utter misconception of even
many visitors to Japan in the matter of the chastity of the
average Japanese women that I venture to transcribe
them: &ldquo;Has it not been repeated to him (the globe-trotter)
that these people have no conception of virtue or
of modesty? So he frequently treats the maids at the
inn, the charming human humming-birds who wait upon
him at the tea-house, and the Geisha summoned to
entertain him, with a cavalier familiarity that would
infallibly lead to his summary expulsion from any well-regulated
hotel or public-house, or other places of public
entertainment at home, did he dare to show such want of
respect to a chambermaid or to one of the haughty fair
ones serving at a bar. He means no harm in nine cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
out of ten; he has been told that Japanese girls don&rsquo;t
mind what you say to them, and as to the tea-house girls,
well, they are no better than they should be ... but they
are good little women, as capable of guarding their virtue
as any in the world, and it saddens one to think how often
they endure, from a feeling of consideration for the
foreigner who does not know any better, they pityingly
think, cavalier treatment they would not submit to from
a Japanese.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said so much I feel I am free to admit that a
somewhat different standard of morality does obtain in
Japan to that which exists, or is supposed to exist, among
Occidental nations. After all, morality is to some extent
a matter of convention, and a people must, I suggest, be
judged rather by the way in which it lives up to its
standard than by the standard itself, which among some
Western nations is not always strictly observed. The
whole subject of morality between the sexes is one upon
which a portly volume might be written. The sexual
relations have been affected by many circumstances, some
of them entirely conventional and having little or nothing
to do with morality as such, while poetry and romance and
sentiment have been allowed to complicate, and still render
difficult a dispassionate consideration of the whole matter.
Macaulay in one of his essays has observed that &ldquo;the
moral principle of a woman is frequently more impaired
by a single lapse from virtue than that of a man by twenty
years of intrigue.&rdquo; He explains this seeming paradox by
asserting that &ldquo;a vice sanctioned by the general opinion
is merely a vice, while a vice condemned by the general
opinion produces a pernicious effect on the whole
character.&rdquo; &ldquo;One,&rdquo; says Macaulay, &ldquo;is a local malady,
the other is a constitutional taint.&rdquo; I have quoted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
famous historian in this connection because his observations
are, I think, illustrative of my contention, viz., that
morality is largely a matter of convention, sanctioned or
condemned by what Macaulay terms &ldquo;the general
opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I frankly admit that prostitution has never been
regarded in Japan as it is, or is affected to be, in this and
other European countries. In ancient days the public
women of the capital and the large towns were as famous
as in Athens of old, and were regarded as amongst the
best educated and best mannered of their sex. The
Japanese have ever looked upon prostitution as what is
termed a necessary evil, and they have always sought to
regulate and supervise it with a view of obviating those
evils, terrible in their consequences, which are frequently
the result of permitting it to go unchecked. And accordingly
the Yoshiwara has long been a recognised institution
in every considerable town in the country, the Yoshiwara
being that particular portion of the town in which prostitutes
are alone permitted to reside. There is, so far as
I know, no prostitution outside the Yoshiwara, and the
inmates thereof are subject to a rigorous supervision and
inspection, medical and otherwise, which has produced
excellent results. The inmates of the Yoshiwara are not
recruited as are the similar class in the West. Here the
&ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; usually plies her trade as a <i>dernier ressort</i>.
In a moment of temptation she has &ldquo;gone wrong,&rdquo; as the
phrase goes, the fact becomes public, she is too often cold-shouldered
and hustled even by her immediate relations,
and her downward progress is swift and certain. Nor is
there for her, except in rare cases, any chance of rehabilitation.
She is too hopeless to exclaim &ldquo;Resurgam!&rdquo; and if
in an optimistic frame of mind she did so purpose she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
would find the consummation difficult if not impossible.
She is, in a word, on the way to irretrievable ruin and a
shameful end, and she knows it.</p>

<p>Such is, as I have said, not the case in Japan. The lot
of the prostitute there has never been regarded with the
loathing which it excites in this country. Houses of ill-fame
were, and are still, recruited not from those whose
previous lapse from virtue has rendered no other mode of
livelihood possible than that from immorality, but by those
whom stern necessity has driven to the step as a means
either of supporting themselves or of assisting parents or
their near relatives. Such a sacrifice&mdash;a terrible sacrifice, I
admit&mdash;has in Japan never been regarded with horror, but
as in a sense laudable. The finger of scorn must not be
pointed at a woman who has voluntarily sacrificed what
women hold most dear, not from lust or from the desire of
leading a gay life or pampering or adorning the body, but
perhaps to save father or kin from ruin or starvation. The
Yoshiwara has, of course, other recruits, but in the main
its inmates are not the victims of lust but of self-sacrifice.
There is too often a whole tragedy in the story of a
Japanese girl of this kind, and it is deplorable when the
self-righteous European comes along and points the finger
of scorn at her. I am aware that though not despised, as
in this country, the lot of the inmate of the Yoshiwara is
often, if not always, a horrible one. She is, as a rule, sold,
or sells herself, for a lump sum of money to which amount
is added the cost of her outfit, usually as much as the price
paid to the woman or her relatives. Until this amount was
worked off&mdash;and the accounts were, of course, not over
accurately kept&mdash;the woman was to all intents the chattel
of her master. This has, undoubtedly, for many centuries
been the custom of the country. I am glad, however, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
be able to state that quite recently the highest court in
Japan has decided that, whatever custom may have
decreed, the law gives, and will give, no sanction to any
such custom. A girl confined in the Yoshiwara was
forcibly taken away therefrom. The owner of the house
in which she resided, as her debt had not been liquidated,
considered he had a lien upon her, and he invoked the aid
of the law to assist him to assert what he considered to be
his rights and retake possession of the girl. The case was
strenuously fought and taken to several courts, with the
result I have stated. This decision will probably have far-reaching
effects and declaring, as it does, that the inmates
of the Yoshiwara are not slaves or chattels, it is to be
cordially welcomed.</p>

<p>The assertion of Miss Bird, already referred to, that the
manhood of Japan is enslaved and degraded by vice is
one which I have no hesitation in describing as gross
exaggeration. Vice, of course, there is in Japan, vice of
various kinds and degrees, but the ordinary Japanese man
is not, in my opinion, nearly so immoral as the average
European. The chastity of the Japanese woman I place
still higher. The fact, already stated, that the inmates of
the Yoshiwara are not generally recruited from those who
have lapsed from virtue might be urged in proof of this.
Nor is the fact that prostitution is not in Japan regarded
with the same loathing as in this country, in my opinion,
to be taken as any evidence of an immoral tone. The
ideas that obtain on the matter, in Japan at any rate,
hold out the possibility of moral redemption for the
inmates of the Yoshiwara, and as a matter of fact many
women in Japan who, through the force of compulsion,
have entered this place, frequently marry, and marry
well, and subsequently live absolutely chaste lives. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
standard of morality among the married women of Japan
is, I may remark, high, and is rarely lowered.</p>

<p>I hope I shall not shock my readers if I remark that
I consider the stringent regulations that exist in Japan as
to the supervision of the Yoshiwara in many respects
admirable. It will probably surprise many persons to
learn that the high state of organisation in regard to
everything connected with the superintendence of these
places, as also the development of lock hospitals, is
largely due to the zeal and exertions of the late Dr. G.
Birnie Hill, of the Royal Navy, who was for many years
lent by the Admiralty to the Japanese Government for
that purpose. Under his auspices a stringent system of
medical supervision was organised, which has been attended
with excellent results in the direction of stamping out
and obviating diseases which, I may observe, are of foreign
importation. I know that the existence of any system of
medical inspection will, in the estimate of a large number
of estimable men and women in this country, be regarded
as proof positive of the immorality of the Japanese.
&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t recognise vice,&rdquo; is their contention. I am
of opinion, on the contrary, that we should either recognise
vice and restrict, restrain, and regulate it, or else
make vice illegal, as the Puritans did, and fine or
imprison both men and women addicted to it. I could
understand either of these two courses, but I must confess
that I altogether fail to fathom the state of mind of
those persons who adopt neither opinion, but either assert
or infer that in the name of religion, morality, modesty,
and many other commendable things, we should permit
our streets and thoroughfares to be infested by women
plying their immoral trade with all the resultant consequences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
As I stated at the commencement of this chapter, a
nation should be judged not only by its standard of
morality but by the degree in which it lives up to or
falls short of that standard. Judged by this, surely the
fairest, the only fair, rule, Japan has every reason to be
considered a moral country. Those shocking crimes
which appear to be the outcome of either the aberration
or the inversion of the sexual instincts are almost
unknown there. Nor do I consider that the public
estimate of prostitution on the whole makes for immorality.
If an evil exist, and prostitution is undoubtedly
an evil, it is surely better to regulate it than
to affect to be oblivious of it. The Japanese attitude
towards prostitution at any rate leaves a door open
for the woman who has, from whatever the reason, lapsed
from the paths of virtue to return thereto. This appears
to my mind to be a more satisfactory state of things than
the continual harrying and worrying of prostitutes in the
name of indignant virtue and the driving of them on the
streets. The aspect of the great thoroughfares of London,
especially by night, does not give the Oriental visitor
thereto a high idea of English morality. It is, nevertheless,
an extraordinary fact that the Englishman or the
Englishwoman who has mayhap lived in London most of
his or her life, when he or she visits Japan in the course
of, perhaps, &ldquo;a round the world trip&rdquo; in ninety days,
and learns that there is in each Japanese town a Yoshiwara,
the inmates of which are subject to supervision and
regulation, lifts up his or her hands in holy horror, returns
home with a virtuous indignation, and has no hesitation
in henceforth declaring, whether in speech or writing, that
the Japanese are a grossly immoral people.</p>

<p>The average Japanese is, very rightly in my opinion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
indignant at the constant assertions of writers, well or
ill-informed, that his country is essentially immoral. He
is not only indignant but astounded. He has, if he has
been to this country, seen here much that has not tended
to impress him with the belief that the English people
are themselves in a position to dogmatise on this vexed
question of morality. He is, if he has visited the great
cities and towns of Great Britain, by no means convinced
that the action of Japan in establishing a Yoshiwara
whose inmates are under proper supervision, medical and
otherwise, is not better from every point of view, that of
morality included, than turning loose women into the
streets to accost every passer-by and place temptations
in the way of youth. On the other hand, the Japanese
who has not left his own country, but is of an observant
nature and of a logical disposition, fails to comprehend
why the European in Europe should dogmatise upon and
affect to be disgusted with what he terms the immorality
of the Japanese. The Japanese who has lived all his life
in his own country has had ample opportunities for studying
the Europeans resident there, and I fear he has not
always been impressed by their high moral tone or their
ultra-moral conduct. I might say much more upon that
head, but I shall refrain.</p>

<p>I conclude this chapter by reiterating the expression of
my belief that the Japanese are, when rightly considered,
a moral people. They have their own code of morals, and
they act up to it. There are few nations of whom as
much could be said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>JAPAN AND CHINA</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE results of the war between Russia and Japan
seem to have caused a large number of persons
to work themselves into a state of incipient panic regarding
what has been graphically, if not quite correctly,
termed &ldquo;the yellow peril.&rdquo; Japan, a nation of some
47,000,000 people, had thrown down the gauntlet and
totally defeated, both by land and sea, one of the great
military Powers of the world. Japan had done all this
as a result of some quarter of a century spent in
modelling and training her Army and Navy on European
lines, and adopting European arms of destruction. Of
course, so argued the panic-mongers, China must be
impressed by such an object-lesson&mdash;China, which has
for so many years past been, and is still being, squeezed
by the European Powers. The result of Japan&rsquo;s triumph
would inevitably be, so we were asked to believe, that
China would invite the former to organise the Chinese
Army and Navy on Japanese lines. As the outcome
thereof, a nation, not of forty, but of four hundred
millions, would be trained to arms, and, if the Chinese
raw material proved as good as the Japanese, a nation
so powerful, if it proceeded West on conquest bent,
would carry everything before it, and, unlike the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Eastern invaders of Europe, the Turks, would be unlikely
to be stopped on its onward course at Vienna.
The German Emperor was amongst those who have
voiced the cry of &ldquo;the yellow peril.&rdquo; He does not,
however, appear to have cast himself for the part of
John Sobieski, with Berlin instead of Vienna as the
decisive battle-ground. The persons who have so argued
and have attempted to raise this silly cry of &ldquo;the yellow
peril,&rdquo; with a view of alarming Europe were, I think,
merely the victims of an exuberant imagination. Their
facts have no existence save in the realms of fancy, and
as they reasoned from faulty premises on imperfect or
erroneous information, their conclusions were, as might
have been expected, not only inaccurate, but absurdly
ludicrous. There is no &ldquo;yellow peril,&rdquo; no prospect whatever
of it, either present or remote.</p>

<p>The attitude of China, that vast though heterogeneous
nation, is, since the close of the Russo-Japanese War, I
admit, one of the most intense interest. Some persons
may consider that in a book about Japan any other
than a passing reference to China is out of place, and
that, moreover, for me to deal with the attitude of China
is to wander into political regions&mdash;a peripatetic proceeding
I deprecated in the Preface. I am of opinion,
however, that it is impossible to thoroughly understand
Japan and to appreciate the attitude of that country
to the Western Powers without some remarks respecting
the present and prospective relations of China and
Japan. I also think that some consideration of this bogey
of &ldquo;the yellow peril&rdquo; is not only out of place but indispensable
in order to form a correct idea of the precise
effect of recent events in the Far East and the possible
outcome of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
To any person who has closely studied Far Eastern
problems the attitude of China since the close of the
war between Japan and Russia is in no way surprising;
the forces that have long been steadily at work in that
ancient Empire are now only attaining any degree of
development. There is nothing, in my opinion, in the
history of the world more dramatic than the way in which
China has waited. That country is now, I believe, about
to show that the waiting policy has been a sound one, and
I am confident it will eventually prove triumphant. In
1900 I expressed in print the opinion that not a single
acre of Japanese soil would ever be permitted to be
annexed by a foreign country; I spoke of the policy
of China for the Chinese, and remarked that that principle
and policy had been repeated throughout the length
and breadth of that vast Empire, and had been absorbed,
as it were, into the very marrow of its people. It is in
many respects interesting and curious, indeed almost
comical, the manner in which that lesson has been
driven home upon the Chinese. Russia has always been
to them a powerful, persistent, and aggressive neighbour,
a more formidable aggressor, indeed, because perhaps
nearer, than any of the other Powers of Europe, whom I
am sorry to say China has always looked upon very much
as the substantial householder regards the burglar. Now
that Japan has tried conclusions with Russia and has
soundly thrashed the latter, great, slumbering China,
proud, conservative, but supremely conscious of its latent
resources, has been waking up. The Chinese, as a matter
of fact, have very little veneration, respect, or esteem, for
their Japanese neighbours. The former plume themselves
on being the aristocrats of the East, and they reason, with
some show of plausibility, that if the upstart Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
have been able to so thoroughly rout the Russian forces
the potential possibilities of China on the warpath are
enormous. Every thoughtful student of the East has looked
forward to what I may term the Japanisation of China as
one of the inevitable results of the recent conflict in the
Far East. To a certain extent the Japanisation of China
has commenced, but at the same time one cannot be
oblivious of the fact that the Chinese, with their traditions
and sense of self-importance, have not the slightest
intention of slavishly following in the lead of those islanders
whom they have always contemned, but mean to strike
out a line for themselves. If what we believe to be
civilisation is to be developed in China, it will be developed
by the Chinese themselves. If they are going
to possess railways, telegraphs, telephones, and all the
machinery of that material advancement which we call
progress, and sometimes civilisation, the Chinese themselves
will be the importers and adapters and, in due
course, the manufacturers thereof.</p>

<p>Now that the great fight in the Far East is over, it
certainly looks as if the Chinese at last realised the fact
that development is an inevitable necessity. The master-spirits
in the country have assuredly come to the conclusion,
possibly with regret, that China can no longer remain in
that delightful state of isolation which permitted every
man in the Empire to spend the arc of his life, from his
cradle to his grave, in a state of restful security. China is,
in spite of herself, and certainly against the inclinations of
the mass of the populace, being swept into the maelstrom
of struggle now that the people, or rather their leaders,
realise the position. Their attitude seems to me to be
magnificent. If railways have to be made they will be
made by the Chinese; the concessions already granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
must&mdash;this is the universal feeling&mdash;be bought back, even
at a profit, from those who have acquired them, by the
Chinese themselves. Not one new concession must, on
any pretence whatever, ever again be granted to a foreigner.
And if this Western civilisation is to be forced upon the
Chinese, they intend to take it with all its attendant
precautions. They are naturally a peaceful and unaggressive
people, but they have grasped the fact that, as a
strong man armed is in the best position to safeguard his
house, however peaceful his individual proclivities may be,
so too, if a nation is to defend its territory and its territorial
wealth against spoliation, it must be armed for that
purpose.</p>

<p>For many years past Great Britain and France and
other countries have been sending missionaries to China
to expound to the Chinese people those sublime doctrines
enunciated in the Sermon on the Mount. The Chinese
have diagnosed, from the acts of the European Powers
generally as well as from the actions of individual
Europeans resident in China, the precise value to be
attached to Christianity. For purely defensive purposes
China will have almost immediately an Army which has
been effectively described by the <i>Times</i> correspondent as
being able to relieve the European Powers of any anxiety
respecting the integrity of the Chinese Empire. People
who have not visited the Far East, and who entirely derive
their opinions and information in regard thereto from the
newspapers, cannot possibly realise what effect the policy
of the European Powers has had upon nations like China
and Japan. A professedly Christian country like Great
Britain going to war to force the sale of opium on a people
who did not want to be debauched; a power like Germany
annexing Kiaochao as a golgotha for two murdered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
priests&mdash;proceedings such as these, and there have been many
such during the last forty or fifty years, have been taken
seriously to heart by the Far Eastern races, whether in
China or Japan. All the time the Occidental Powers,
with a total lack of any sense of humour, have persisted in
sending missionaries to these people to inculcate doctrines
which are the very antitheses of the practices of European
nations to these people whom it is sought to convert. It
would be, in my opinion, nothing more than the outcome
of eternal justice if this great big, old, sleepy China, which
has been for so many years pricked and prodded and
despoiled, were at length to take up arms for a great
revenge. But China, if my prevision be correct, is going
to do nothing of the kind. What she does mean to do is
simply to keep China for the Chinese. She is not, as so
many persons imagined and still imagine would be the
case, going to be led as a powerful ox with a Japanese
driver. Chinese students are in hundreds in Japan, learning
from that country all that the Japanese have acquired
from Europe. Young, alert, capable men I found them
without exception, sucking the brains of all that is best in
Japan precisely as the Japanese have sucked the brains of
all that is best in Europe for their own objects and to
their own advantage. The immediate danger in China
seems, so far as I can judge, to be that the anti-foreign
feeling, which is undoubtedly intense especially in the
south of the Empire, may come to a head any day and
prematurely explode. The nincompoops and quidnuncs
and newspaper men ravenous for copy who prate about a
&ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo; may, in this latter fact, find some slight
excuse for their blatant lucubrations. There is no real
&ldquo;yellow peril.&rdquo; Poor old China, which has been so long
slumbering, is just rousing herself and making arrangements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
for defence against the &ldquo;white peril,&rdquo; materialistic
civilisation, and misrepresented Christianity.</p>

<p>The only &ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo; that I have been able to
diagnose is the peril to the trade of Europe and the
United States of America with China&mdash;a peril that appears
to me to be imminent. That Japan intends to capture a
large, indeed the largest, proportion of that trade I am
firmly convinced. That she will succeed in effecting her
object I have not the slightest doubt. At the present
moment only about 5 per cent. of the imports into China
are from Japan, the remainder being either from India,
Europe, or America. Situated in close contiguity to
China, having assimilated everything of importance not
only in regard to the employment but the manufacture of
machinery from Europe and the United States, possessing
an industrious and intelligent population, Japan is quite
obviously in a magnificent position to supply China, and
supply her on much better terms, with the greater number
of those commodities which China now has to import
either from Europe or America. Japan, as I have said,
intends to lay herself out to capture the major portion of
this trade; she is quite justified in doing so, and there is
every reason to suppose that she will attain her object.</p>

<p>That the Chinese students who have come to Japan and
are flocking there month by month in increasing numbers,
with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to assimilate all
those Western influences and ideas and aids that have
placed Japan in her present prominent position among the
nations, when they, in due course, return to their own
country, will of a certainty exercise a considerable influence
therein, there can be no doubt. I also feel sure that
Japan will render considerable assistance to China in
regard to the remodelling and reorganisation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Chinese Army and Navy. It is as certain as anything
in this uncertain world that before very many years have
elapsed the naval and military forces of China will undergo
as great a transformation as those of Japan have undergone.
I believe, and I may say that this belief is shared
by a number of naval and military men who have had
practical opportunities for forming an opinion in the
matter, that the raw material existing in China for the
making of an effective and efficient Army and Navy is as
good as that in Japan. We know that the late General
Gordon, who had excellent opportunities for arriving at a
sound conclusion in the matter, expressed himself in glowing
terms in regard to the capabilities of the Chinaman as
a soldier were he properly trained, organised, and officered.
But that China, any more than Japan, entertains ambitious
military projects I utterly disbelieve. The only aspiration
of China as regards Europe is&mdash;to be let alone. She fears,
as she has every reason to fear, European aggression. She
has had ample experience in the past that the flimsiest
pretexts have been utilised for the purpose of filching her
territory and exacting from her pecuniary fines under the
name of indemnities. We know by a recent incident that
the indemnity exacted from China by this country in
respect of the Boxer rebellion was not really required for
the ostensible purposes for which it was imposed. A large
proportion of it lay at the Bank of England unappropriated,
and eventually was attached by a rapacious
Chancellor of the Exchequer for the purpose of alleviating
the burdens of the British taxpayer. China is determined
to have no more incidents such as this in the future, and
the Russo-Japanese War has given her occasion for serious
thought in the matter as well as pointed an obvious moral.
As a result of her cogitations, she has concluded that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
most effective means she can take in the direction of
preserving the inviolability of her territory and preventing
the exaction of periodical monetary tributes on the part of
foreign Powers, is to establish a strong and efficient Army
and Navy. As a matter of fact, I consider that in so
determining China is acting not only in her own interests,
but in the interests of the Great Powers of Europe.</p>

<p>Not very many years ago that excellent sailor, Lord
Charles Beresford, wrote a book entitled, somewhat too
previously, &ldquo;The Break-up of China.&rdquo; In selecting a title
for his work Lord Charles without doubt voiced the
opinion prevalent, not only in this country but in Europe,
at the time he wrote it. The statesmen of nearly all the
foreign Powers then seemed to have arrived at the conclusion
that the scramble for China was imminent and,
utilising their experience from what took place when the
scramble for Africa was effected twenty years ago, they
began apportioning in advance the territory that ought to
fall to their lot. In this matter, however, they were wofully
mistaken; the diplomatic physicians of the world may
have diagnosed the symptoms quite accurately, but the
patient surprised them all in regard to the course of the
disease and her recuperative powers. There will be no
&ldquo;break-up&rdquo; of China, and consequently we are not likely
to witness any scramble for China. There has undoubtedly
been an awakening of China, an awakening to her danger,
to a sense of the extent to which her interests were
imperilled. She wants, as I have said, to be severely left
alone, and she is determined as far as possible to effect
that consummation. The men of light and leading in
China know perfectly well that they cannot now, even if
they would, shut their country against European trade,
European residents, European visitors. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
prepared to accept all these, but they will not have European
interference. China is determined to work out her own
destiny or salvation, call it which you will, and Japan is
both willing and anxious to give her all possible assistance
in that direction. The &ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo; bogey is, in my
opinion, the silliest and most absurd cry that has ever
been put forward by responsible persons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>EUROPEANS IN JAPAN</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>IKE everything else in Japan, the status and position
of the foreigner have been materially changed, in
fact revolutionised, of recent years. When the country
was, in the first instance, opened after its long period
of isolation from the rest of the world, treaties were signed
with Great Britain, the United States, France, and nearly
all the other European Powers, whereby Japan agreed to
open seven ports, subsequently known as &ldquo;treaty ports,&rdquo;
to foreign trade in which ports foreigners were to be
permitted to reside and to carry on their business.
Foreigners were at the same time&mdash;not by the wish of
the Japanese Government, but as the outcome of the
pressure put upon Japan by the various Powers&mdash;granted
extra-territorial rights, that is to say they were exempt
from the jurisdiction of the Japanese courts of law. This
being the case foreign courts were constituted in Japan
with jurisdiction over the subjects of the nation which
set up the court. In these courts foreigners sued and were
sued, and crimes committed by and against foreigners
were tried. As regards Great Britain a Supreme Court
for China and Japan was constituted whose headquarters
were at Shanghai. There were Consular Courts and a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
involved kind of legal procedure generally established,
mostly by Order in Council, which I need not consider
in detail as it is now effete. There was, moreover, as
regards Great Britain at any rate, a Bar practising in these
courts, one member of which, Mr. F.&nbsp;V. Dickins, is justly
remembered not for his forensic but for his literary efforts
in the direction of depicting the inner life of the Japanese
people. Into these foreign courts all the jargon, the quips
and quibbles of English law were imported. These courts
were, not unnaturally, an eyesore to the Japanese people.
I may observe in passing that these extra-territorial courts
still exist in China, and though the Supreme Court of
China and Japan has been shorn of that part of its title
which refers to Japan it remains, and is likely for some
time longer to remain, the supreme legal tribunal of the
English residents in the Chinese Empire. But besides
extra-territorial courts there were extra-territorial post-offices.
The English, the American, and, I think, the
French Governments had post-offices in Japan which
transacted postal duties of all kinds just as if they had
been in London, New York, and Paris instead of in a
foreign country. There may have been some excuse for
this in the early days; but these foreign post-offices
remained until quite recently, depriving Japan of a portion
of her revenue at a time when she had developed a
magnificent postal service of her own. Over and above
foreign courts and post-offices there were actually foreign
municipal bodies. A certain amount of ground at the
treaty ports was constituted a foreign settlement wherein
the foreigners resided. Within these settlements a municipal
council was formed, which regulated everything
therein. In these settlements the Japanese Government
had no more power or authority than they had in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Battersea. These settlements were in effect foreign
territory on the Japanese soil, to use what seems to be a
paradox.</p>

<p>In exchange for the privilege of extra-territoriality
granted to foreign residents in Japan, they were placed
under restrictions. These included not being able to
travel in the country outside a radius of 25 miles
from the treaty ports unless provided with passports,
which, I may remark, there was never any difficulty in
obtaining, and not being permitted to live beyond the
same radius. Foreigners engaged in trade in Japan had
a great advantage in regard to a very low scale of customs
duties, not more than 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, but they were
strictly prohibited from owning land. This system of
extra-territoriality was extremely unpopular with the
whole of the Japanese people, and a constant movement
was in force in the country for the abrogation of what the
Japanese considered an invidious distinction and in the
direction of making every person who voluntarily took up
residence in Japan answerable to the law of the land and
under the jurisdiction of the Japanese courts. The revenue
of the country was also, of course, injuriously effected by
the post-office privileges already referred to as well as by
the differential treatment of foreigners in regard to import
duties. As was to be expected, any proposal for the
abolition of extra-territorial rights and the revision of
the regulations in regard to import duties met with a
strenuous opposition from the foreign residents in Japan.
On the other hand, it must be confessed that the Japanese
people opposed any compromise in the direction of granting
foreigners facilities in return for the privileges that
were asked to be waived. The proposal to allow
foreigners to own land was vigorously inveighed against.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
So was a suggestion to establish mixed courts&mdash;the kind of
compromise, by the way, which would probably have
equally irritated foreigners and natives. It is, I think,
satisfactory to be able to relate that in the end and after
many years of agitation it was the British Government
which took the initiative in the matter, and some ten or
twelve years ago concluded a treaty with Japan wherein
the privileges of English courts, European municipalities,
and differential import duties were abandoned, while in
return proprietary rights, except in regard to land, were
granted to foreigners.</p>

<p>There are, mayhap, some persons at the present day who
are not aware of the fact that for a good many years after
Japan was to a limited extent opened to foreigners several
of the Powers retained an armed force in that country for
the protection of foreign residents. Great Britain, for
instance, had a large number of marines at Yokohama.
The presence of these troops was extremely unpalatable
to the Japanese authorities, but of course pleasing to the
foreign residents, who opposed their withdrawal just as
they opposed the abrogation of extra-territoriality. I am
afraid the reason for the removal of this armed force as
far as Great Britain was concerned was economic rather
than founded on any particular principle. Be that as it
may, in 1873 Japan was successful in assuring the British
Government that she was able and prepared to protect all
foreigners residing in the country, and in that year the last
foreign soldier was withdrawn from Japanese territory.</p>

<p>Those who remember the agitation&mdash;and a very fierce
and noisy and provocative agitation it was&mdash;in opposition
to the revision of Japan&rsquo;s treaties with the foreign Powers
with a view of getting rid of extra-territoriality will have
a lively recollection of the pessimistic forebodings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
speakers and writers in reference to the future of the
foreign community in that country were the exclusive
privileges they then enjoyed taken away from them. The
gentlemen who uttered these sentiments were no doubt
sincerely convinced of their truth, but I am glad to be
able to relate that time has shown them to have been
false prophets. There may be, and no doubt are, foreigners
in Japan who bemoan the good old days, but I am
confident that the great mass of the foreign community
now recognises the fact that the revision of the treaties
and the withdrawal of extra-territorial privileges were
inevitable and that no evil results have ensued in
consequence. The Japanese courts of law have neither
terrorised nor oppressed foreigners. They have, on the
contrary, sought to hold the scales of justice evenly, and
I believe that these courts now enjoy, as I am sure they
deserve, the fullest confidence in their integrity and justice
of every foreigner residing in the country.</p>

<p>I have noticed a tendency on the part of writers on
Japan to refer to the foreign community in that Empire as
if it were a community bound together by some particular
principle and working in unison for some definite object.
Of course such a view is nonsensical. The foreign
community in Japan, in which for the purpose of my
remarks I do not include the Chinese, is one composed of
a large number of nationalities which have very little in
common, and amongst whom a good deal of rivalry
prevails. It may have been that when the question
of revising the treaties was being keenly agitated, self-interest,
or what was deemed to be self-interest, occasioned
a sort of fictitious unity among foreigners, but at the
present time, so far as my observation has gone, there is
very little real unity among the foreigners in Japan. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
English, of course, predominate in numbers, and they have
also the major portion of the trade in their hands.
Whether such a condition of things will much longer
obtain is a moot question. I am of opinion, as I have
elsewhere indicated, that the trade of Japan will very
largely pass into the hands of the Japanese themselves,
and that the foreign element in Japan is accordingly not
only unlikely to increase in number but is almost certain
to diminish.</p>

<p>In the early days when Japan was first opened to the
Western world and English traders went there to push
their commodities, we heard a good deal about the peculiar
ethics of Japanese commercial morality. The European
merchant either was, or affected to be, shocked at the
loose commercial code of honour of those with whom he
was brought into contact in Japan, and he expressed
himself accordingly. However much or little ground
there may have been for these accusations many years
ago I am not in a position to judge. In forming any
opinion in this matter, if that opinion is to be correct,
it is, I think, essential to remember the conditions of
society in Japan when it was first opened to European
trade. In old Japan there were four recognised classes
of society&mdash;the Samurai, the farmers, the artisans, and
the merchants. The last two were somewhat looked
down upon by the others. It is, accordingly, hardly to
be wondered at that the condition of industry and commerce
was the least satisfactory feature in the initial
stages of national development. Despised alike by the
gentry and the peasantry, the traders were in a somewhat
sorry plight when Japan was thrown open. The
low social status of the trading class in Japan was due
to the feudal ideas which prevailed for so many centuries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The people were impressed with the productive power of
the soil, and jumped at the conclusion that the merchant
class must necessarily be immoral, since it purchased the
produce of the soil at a low price and sold it at a profit.
Very similar ideas have prevailed in countries other than
Japan. It is not so very many years ago that in England
a man of good family, much less a member of the aristocracy,
going into trade was looked upon with no very
favourable eyes. We know that the ideas that not so very
many years ago obtained in this country in reference to
this matter have entirely altered. Trade is now considered
to furnish most excellent scope and opportunities for the
energy and capital of all classes of the community. And
the same ideas have been working in Japan. The merchant
there is no longer a member of a despised class.
The scions of the most ancient families in Japan, as in
England, have embarked in trade and brought to their
business those high ideals which they have derived from
their ancestors. The criticisms of commercial morality in
Japan which were so prevalent not very many years ago
are now entirely obsolete. I fear, however, that the effect
of them still to some extent remains, and that there are a
large number of people in this country who even now
believe that the Japanese, from a commercial point of
view, are what is termed &ldquo;tricky.&rdquo; I hope my remarks
on this head may serve to disabuse the minds of some
of those persons who still entertain these extremely
erroneous ideas.</p>

<p>I do not think that there is a very large amount of
social intercourse between the Europeans in Japan and
the Japanese themselves. The European in the East, or
at any rate the Englishman in the East, so far as I have
been able to judge, always appears to me to assume an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
air&mdash;it may be an unconscious air&mdash;of superiority to the
inhabitants of the country in which he resides. That this
is frequently extremely galling to them there can be no
question. Any one who has conversed with the intelligent
native of India must be aware of that fact. Whether the
greatness of the Anglo-Saxon race be in some degree or in
a large measure due to the belief that the Anglo-Saxon has
in himself is a question I need not consider. But I think
there can be no doubt of the fact that this sense of
superiority, however much or little justification there may
be for it, is a characteristic not likely to be appreciated
by foreigners, and especially Orientals, and I think I am
justified in remarking that the Japanese do not at all
appreciate it.</p>

<p>The European may impress the Oriental in one of
several ways; he has for the most part done so by his
great military or naval prowess. That is the way in
which Great Britain has impressed the natives of India.
The English are in that country as a conquering race.
They have practically never been defeated, and the respect
which they have obtained is the respect that the weak
have for the strong. In Japan such a state of things is
no longer possible. The results of the Russian War have
rendered it impossible for all time. An Oriental nation
has met a European Power on the field and on the high
seas, and soundly thrashed it. There is, however, another
way in which the European might impress the Oriental.
The former professes to have a purer religion and a higher
code of morals. He has sought to impose his religion
upon every race with which he has been brought into
contact, and if he has not sought to impose his moral
system, he has, at any rate, severely criticised that of
the people with whom he has been brought into contact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and compared it with his own to their disadvantage. In
Japan, where there is a large foreign community, the
thinking, logical Japanese has had abundant opportunities
for studying not only the principles of Western religions
and Western morality, but also the practice of them by
Western residents in his own land.</p>

<p>The result has been to give him much food for reflection.
He reads the criticisms of Europe upon the Yoshiwara and
the Japanese attitude generally towards prostitution, while
he has ample evidence of the fact that many of the patrons
of the Yoshiwara are to be found among the European
community in Japan. And so of religion. The various
Christian denominations of the Western world aspire to
convert Japan, and send missionaries there for that purpose.
The Japanese gives them a fair field, and he has
shown no aversion to investigate their dogmas. At the
same time he sees that a large proportion, I might perhaps
say the majority, of the European residents in Japan do
not trouble to attend the Christian places of worship, while
many of them make no disguise of their contempt for
Christianity in general and the missionaries in particular.
What conclusion, may I ask, can the logical, reasoning
Japanese come to in these matters?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt whatever that the foreign residents
in Japan have accomplished a great work in regard
to the development of the country. The settlements
established by them at the various treaty ports and the
administration of those settlements as municipalities reflected
great credit upon all those concerned, and was a
splendid object-lesson for the Japanese people. Great
Britain, too, may, I think, be congratulated on the men
she has selected to represent her at the Japanese Court.
There is no man to whom both Great Britain and Japan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
are more indebted than the late Sir Harry Parkes. I
cannot remember during how many years he was the
British Minister at Tokio, but during the whole of his
term of office he used his best endeavours in the direction
of showing Japan the way she ought to go in the path of
progress, and in rendering her all the assistance possible in
that direction by procuring for her the very best assistance
of every description. I strongly advise every person
interested in Japan and its development to peruse the Life
of Sir Harry Parkes, by Mr. F.&nbsp;V. Dickins and Mr. Stanley
L. Poole. One interesting feature in Sir Harry Parkes&rsquo;s
career I may record here, as I have had it on the authority
of a gentleman conversant with the facts. Sir Harry was
always a <i>persona gratissima</i> with the Japanese Government,
and about the year 1877 he and the late Admiral
Sir A.&nbsp;P. Ryder, then Commander-in-Chief on the China
station, had a conversation respecting, in view of the
aggressive policy of Russia in the Far East, obtaining a
British coaling station much further north than Hong
Kong. Admiral Ryder mentioned as an appropriate
place the island of Tsu-shima, so famous in the recent
war with Russia. Sir Harry Parkes promised to use his
good offices with the Japanese Government to obtain permission
to occupy this island with a view of its ultimate
cession to Great Britain. The permission was duly
obtained, and Admiral Ryder thereupon cabled home to
the Admiralty for the necessary permission to take over
the island. His request was promptly vetoed, and Great
Britain, accordingly, lost for ever the opportunity of obtaining
an admirable coaling station and a splendid strategical
position in the Far East. It is quite certain that Japan
does not now regret the refusal of Great Britain to accept
her too generous offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Europeans have been in Japan, and very much in
evidence, during the past half-century or so, but I do
not think that the residents in the country have exercised
much influence upon Japan. During that period there
have been enormous changes; the whole life of the nation
has, in fact, been revolutionised. But these changes have
not been wrought, or indeed greatly affected, by the
European residents in the country. The changes have
emanated from Europe and America&mdash;not that portion of
Europe and America which went to Japan for its own
objects. I make, of course, a particular exception in
regard to those naval and military and scientific men
to whose exertions Japan owes so much of her advancement.
But I do say of the ordinary trader or merchant
that he has come to Japan, and left it without producing
much effect, if any, on the development of the nation, or
leaving behind him any influences of a useful nature.</p>

<p>The European in Japan necessarily suggests some
allusion to that large and annually increasing number of
persons who visit the country. Their residence in Japan
is usually of very limited duration, but, however short it
may be, it is apparently quite long enough to enable them
to form pronounced views upon many and varied matters
connected with the country and the people. I have no
hesitation in asserting that the erroneous opinions so
prevalent in Europe in regard to Japan and the Japanese
people are largely the outcome of the far too numerous
books that have been written and published in reference to
that country of recent years. &ldquo;Ten Days in Japan&rdquo; may
be an alluring title for a book of travel, but quite evidently
ten days are not sufficient to form an opinion and promulgate
it upon every phase of Japanese life, nor for the
solution of many vexed problems. And yet, so far as my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
perusal of these books has gone, the shorter the period a
man or woman has spent in Japan the more pronounced
his or her views in regard to the country. The matter is
hardly worth referring to were it not that these opinions,
hastily arrived at and apparently as hurriedly rushed into
print, have been accepted by some people as incontrovertible
facts. Another class of work that I think a
reader should be warned against is the book of the man
who has lived in Japan for a time and seen life only from
a certain standpoint. The book of a bishop or a missionary
may be and often is of undoubted value in
reference to his work and matters connected with his
work, but when the writer gets outside this particular
province and deals with subjects his knowledge of which
must be at the best second-hand he is almost certain to
perpetrate some flagrant mistakes, and occasionally indite
the most egregious nonsense. I shall not particularly
apply these remarks, but I think it necessary to utter this
word of warning as the literary effusions of some very
estimable men and women in regard to Japan have given
occasion for many false misconceptions being entertained
in regard to that country.</p>

<p>The cry of &ldquo;Japan for the Japanese&rdquo; has undoubtedly
been heard in that land, and during the agitation over the
revision of the treaties the foreign community appeared to
be under the impression that the policy emphasised in that
cry was the one which Japan desired to attain. For
myself I do not believe it. I am positive that Japan to-day
has no desire to exclude foreigners, or to revert into her
old position of isolation. I believe, on the contrary, that
she desires to welcome foreigners and to give them every
facility within proper limits for pursuing their enterprises.
At the same time she has no desire for the foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
adventurer, prospector, or embryo company promoter.
She does not wish, in fact, that Japan shall be exploited
either in respect of minerals or any other purpose with the
object of directly or indirectly pouring wealth into London
or any other city. The enterprising gentlemen from
England and other countries who have sought to obtain
concessions of various kinds in Japan have failed in their
object. Their efforts would probably only have brought
discredit on the country, and could hardly by any possibility
have aided in its material advancement. There is
only one word of advice that I should feel inclined to
proffer the European in Japan, and that is to refrain less
from exercising his caustic wit at the expense of the
Japanese people. A nation which has passed through
such drastic changes as have characterised Japan in the
last two or three decades can no doubt furnish abundant
opportunities for the jibes of the flippant, and the humour
of those who consider they are endowed with a pretty wit.
But the exercise of sardonic humour and an excessive
sarcasm tends to promote ill-feeling and serves no useful
purpose. The right spirit, in my opinion, for any man to
regard Japan is as a nation struggling to obtain and
assimilate all that is best in the world and aspiring to be
in fact an eclectic power. It can at least be said of Japan
that it is the only nation in the world&rsquo;s history which has
entertained such aspirations and has sought to give effect
to them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>A VISIT TO SOME BUDDHIST TEMPLES</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> WAS lying awake in my room in the Myako Hotel,
the window looking out across the town below towards
the eastern hills and framed with clusters of red
maple. It was the clear stillness of a frosty morning
before dawn, not motion enough in the autumn air to stir
a ripe red maple leaf, and as I lay in bed suddenly the
air itself seemed to heave a sigh of music mellow, soft,
and yet full, gradual in its coming as in its going, all-pervading,
strange and wonderful. Stillness again, and
then it came again, or rather not so much came as was
there, and then was not there; for it seemed to come from
no whither, and to leave not even the footprint of an
echo in the air behind. There was sanctity in the very
sound itself. Its music was like vocal incense arising
before the &ldquo;awful rose of dawn,&rdquo; beyond those purple
eastern hills. How unlike, I thought, the jar and clangour
of our church bells in London on a Sunday morning
rattling like a fire alarm, whose only possible religious
suggestion is to tumble out of bed to escape the flames of
hell. The musical summons of this bell was sufficient,
however, to induce me to go out for a stroll through the
temples in the morning twilight.</p>

<p>All on the crest of the hill behind the hotel is a row of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
temples crowning the height. One mounts a flight of
steps and then comes on avenues with rows of ancient
trees on either side that make the avenues look like great
aisles of which the immense trees are the columns supporting
the deep, blue roof. Nothing is more striking
about these temples than the delightful harmony between
their natural surroundings and the buildings themselves.
They blend so perfectly that one loses sight of the meeting
between nature and art. From the steps onward all
seems a harmonious part of the sanctified whole. Trees,
creepers, and natural flowers peep in and almost entwine
themselves with the marvellously painted or carved foliage
of the temple itself. The rich lichens and mosses of the
tree-trunks vie in depth and beauty of colour with the
inlaid traceries of the columns.</p>

<p>Early as the hour was I was not alone in the first
temple I came to. With tinkling steps of wooden shoes
a little woman pattered up the stone stairs to one of the
shrines, pulled the heavy cord of the small bell above her
head to awaken the attention of the Deity, and then with
joined hands encircled with beads and with bowed head
whispered her morning prayer. I just caught in soft,
supplicatory accents the opening words, &ldquo;Namu Amida
Butsu&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hear me, compassionate Lord Buddha&rdquo;&mdash;words
that soon become familiar as one visits these
temples; the great refrain of these people&rsquo;s prayers
when they pray before the image of &ldquo;Him, honoured,
wisest, best, most pitiful, whose lips comfort the world.&rdquo;
And then, having finished her prayers, the little woman
pattered back to her home in the town below, while others
come and make their devotions likewise, all leaving the
temple as if that placid, inscrutable image had whispered
in the ear of each some word of comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
In the courtyard beyond the great Temple of Kiomidyu
I came upon a wonderful bell. There was room for over a
dozen men to stand inside the great bronze shell. It was
hung just above the ground between plain timber uprights,
and the mellow softness of tone was accounted for by the
way in which it was struck. Instead of metal striking
against metal a great tree-trunk is suspended horizontally
outside; this is swung backwards and forwards and then
allowed to strike against the metal. Even when standing
close to it there is nothing one would call noise, but a
great, full, rich sound fills the air in a manner impossible to
describe. I passed on to the latticed shrine dedicated to
Kamnoshut No Kami, the goddess of lovers. As I waited
there three little Japanese girls came up the steps. Each
had a small piece of paper in her hand, and winding them
up they deftly placed the papers in the lattice with the
thumb and little finger of their hands. On these were
written their petitions. One of them held a bunch of
brilliant maple leaves in her hand, and judging from their
faces&mdash;plain little faces all of them&mdash;it was easy to understand
they wanted divine assistance in their love affairs.
It was difficult to understand the goddess retaining any
reputation for compassion if their prayers were not
answered. After they had gone next came a dainty little
geisha, a pretty girl, whose lover must have been a sad
worry to her, judging by the look on her anxious little
face, as she placed her petition between the bars.</p>

<p>All through these temples it was obvious that the
agnosticism, or indifference, or attitude of &ldquo;politeness towards
possibilities,&rdquo; which has apparently taken possession
of the upper classes in Japan, possibly as the result of
contact with the West, is in no way prevalent among the
masses. In all the country parts that I visited and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
large temples in the great cities there was everywhere
evidence of faith as sincere and devout as can be found in
the churches of the most Christian country in Europe.
Unlike China, there was nowhere any sign of the temples
falling into decay. Every temple in China looks like a
neglected mausoleum decaying over the corpse of a dead
religion, and the priests look like sextons of a neglected
graveyard. But here in Kyoto two of the largest temples
were undergoing elaborate repairs, and in Tokio an
immense new temple is being erected in the heart of the
city. In Kyoto at the Temple of Nishi Hong Wangi I was
present at a great seven days&rsquo; religious festival. From
nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning until six o&rsquo;clock in the evening
the temple was perpetually thronged with people. I
visited it in the afternoon. In one large room a priest
was preaching. His congregation was largely composed
of country people from all the districts round, who had
journeyed in with their wives and families. There had
been an abundant harvest, it was over and stored, and the
people had come to give thanks. A great part of the
congregation were blue-clad peasants with white handkerchiefs
around their heads. Many of them had brought
their children with them.</p>

<p>The priest preached sitting down, in a quiet conversational
tone. From what a Japanese friend was kind
enough to translate for me, there was nothing esoteric in
the Buddhism he was teaching. It was simply plain
lessons to the people, how to make good their simple lives
interspersed with stories and anecdotes that occasionally
amused his congregation. Following the crowd that kept
streaming out from his hall towards the larger temple,
I passed under a plain portico of huge wooden columns,
severe and simple on the outside, but gorgeous with rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
carvings of gold lacquer panels and hangings of richly
wrought embroideries within. The entire floor of the
great building was crowded, and the overflow of the congregation
knelt upon the flags outside the door. With
difficulty I picked my way inside. Two rows of priests in
brilliantly coloured vestments were arranged on either
side of the central figure of Buddha. Between them was
the chief priest. Behind the altar screen was an invisible
choir. In alternating numbers the solemn, supplicating
chant was led by either row of priests. In a way it
reminded one of the Gregorian chant one often hears in
Catholic churches, but in this Buddhist chanting there
was that curious Oriental strain of semi-tones that gave a
strange and peculiar plaint to the chorus.</p>

<p>Faint blue columns of incense were streaming slowly
from bronze censors towards the carved roof, and diffusing
a delightful aromatic odour throughout the building.
The congregation was composed of all sorts and conditions
of the population, although the majority were peasants;
there were a number of Japanese ladies who came
accompanied by their maids, and here and there the
brighter costume of a Geisha was to be seen among the
crowd.</p>

<p>The series of services lasted for seven days. This was
the fifth. Beginning at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, it
went on till six o&rsquo;clock in the evening. It was just at its
conclusion while I was there. Mingling with the chorus
from the priests and the choir ran a low murmur from
the crowd. The old country men and women said their
prayers aloud, and the refrain of &ldquo;Namu Amida Butsu&rdquo;
seemed perpetually in one&rsquo;s ears. As the conclusion of
the service approached, the voices of the choir, the priests,
and the congregation increased in strength and volume,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and ceased suddenly in a final chord of supplication. For
a few moments there was stillness over the bowed heads
of the congregation, and then the priests rose and the
crowd began to stream down the great flight of steps. In
the streets outside were rows of booths, where printed
prayers and brightly embroidered triangular cloths, beads
and images were being sold as mementoes of these services.
The whole congregation, even old men and women, as
they toddled down the steps at the base of which they
put on their shoes, reminded one forcibly of a lot of
children coming out from school. Laughing, chattering,
and joking, there was a look of satisfaction and contentment
on all their faces, returning homewards, as if they
felt that in reply to their prayer, &ldquo;Namu Amida Butsu,&rdquo;
the compassionate Lord Buddha, had listened to their
prayer, and whispered in answer to the heart of each,
&ldquo;Comfort ye, my people.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE AINOS</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> BOOK on Japan would be incomplete without some
reference to the Ainos, that mysterious race found,
and found only, in the northern island of Yesso. The
Ainos have long been the puzzle of the ethnologist.
Where the Ainos came from or to what other race they
are akin are problems that have given occasion for much
learned dissertation, but are still as far off solution as
ever. Mr. Basil Chamberlain, all of whose writings upon
Japan are replete with erudition and information, has
observed that the Aino race deserves to be studied because
&ldquo;its domain once extended over the entire Japanese
Archipelago,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;because it is, so to speak, almost
at its last gasp.&rdquo; Unfortunately the evidence for the latter
fact is more conclusive than for the former. The Ainos
are, it seems, to be no exception to that mysterious law of
the survival of the fittest, which decrees that an inferior
race shall go down before the superior, and in due course
become merely a name. I have called this a mysterious
law because such disappearance is not necessarily the
result of conquest or of ruthless destruction. When the
inferior race is brought into contact with the superior it
seems, by some mysterious process, to be infected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the elements of decay, to be impregnated with the germs
of annihilation. And, accordingly, it comes about, in
accordance with the dictates of the law I have referred to,
that although a society has been founded in Japan very
much on the lines of our Aborigines Protection Society,
an Aino Preservation Society, the Ainos seem doomed
to extinction at no far-distant date.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Ainos once inhabited the whole of
the Japanese islands and trekked north to get away from
their conquerors, there can be no doubt of the fact that
they are in almost every respect the very antithesis of the
Japanese. The latter are a smooth-skinned race, the
Ainos an extremely hairy one. The Japanese are essentially
a clean, a scrupulously clean people, the Ainos just
as essentially dirty. The long beards and general facial
appearance of the latter are altogether in startling contrast
to the physiognomy of the average Japanese.</p>

<p>When ethnology fails to place a race, philology often
steps in with more or less of success. The Aino language
has been profoundly studied by many eminent philologists,
but I do not think the results have tended to throw much,
if any, light on the mystery as to the origin and racial
affinities of the Ainos. In general structure the language
is not unlike that of the Japanese, but this might be
expected as the result of centuries of intercourse between
the two people.</p>

<p>The Ainos live almost solely by fishing and hunting.
The Japanese laws, which have year by year been made
more stringent, have somewhat interfered with the sporting
proclivities of the people. Nets and fish traps are
now forbidden, and fishing for the most part is effected by
means of a spear or harpoon, either from the shore or
from the somewhat primitive canoes used by the people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Poisoned arrows were once largely used for the purpose
of capturing game, but they are now forbidden by law.
Originally the <i>modus operandi</i> in hunting was to set a trap
with one of these arrows placed in it, and drive the game
on to the same. The head of the arrow was only loosely
fastened, and broke, leaving the poison inside even if the
animal managed to pull out the shaft. The bear is found
in Yesso, and that animal has entered very largely into
every phase of Aino life, somewhat circumscribed though
this is. That animal was, or used to be, the objective point
of Aino festivals, and seems, to some extent at any rate,
to have had a part in their crude religious ideas. Bears,
are, however, becoming rare in Yesso, and the Japanese
Government, which is paternal even in regard to the fauna
of the islands, has from time to time interfered with many
venerable Aino customs.</p>

<p>The religion of this interesting race is almost as mysterious
as everything else appertaining to it. The Ainos
have no idols and no temples, and their religious rites are
of a decidedly simple nature. They, however, seem to
believe in an infinity of spirits inhabiting various and
varied things, and their pantheon is seemingly a crowded
one. I have said seemingly, because the beliefs of a people
such as this are difficult to get at, and even when one has
got at them almost impossible to comprehend. One writer
has termed the religion of the Ainos, &ldquo;a very primitive
nature-worship,&rdquo; and their gods &ldquo;invisible, formless conceptions.&rdquo;
Such definitions do not convey much information.
Nature-worship is a vague description and &ldquo;invisible,
formless conceptions&rdquo; of the deity or deities are not
confined to the Ainos. Possibly, like all peoples but
little advanced or developed mentally, their religious
conceptions are of the vaguest and have assumed no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
definite shape. A fear of the unknown, a blind groping
in the dark are, mayhap, all that the Aino possesses in
reference to the spiritual world.</p>

<p>Although the religion of the Aino when living is
somewhat incomprehensible his religious ceremonies in
reference to the dead are of a somewhat elaborate nature.
After life has become extinct the first proceeding is to
light an enormous fire in the house. The corpse is then
dressed in its best clothes and laid beside the fire, where
are also placed dishes, a drinking-cup, and the implements
of the chase. In the case of a woman, instead of these,
her beads and other ornaments are laid alongside of her;
for both sexes a pipe and a tobacco-box, so greatly used
during life, are considered essentials when dead. Cakes
made of rice or millet and a cup of sak&eacute;, are also put upon
the floor. A kind of wake or funeral feast follows, at
which the mourners throw some sak&eacute; on the corpse as
a libation to its departed spirit, break off pieces of the
cake and bury it in the ashes. The body is covered
with a mat slung upon a pole and carried to the grave,
followed by the mourners, each of whom places something
in the grave, which, it is believed, will be carried
to the next world with the spirit of the deceased person.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the mourners wash
their hands in water which has been brought for the
purpose. This is then thrown on the grave and the
vessel which conveyed it is broken in pieces and also
thrown on the grave. The widow of the deceased shaves
her head, while the man cuts his beard and hair, as outward
symbols of grief. Many of these ceremonies, it
will be seen, are such as are more or less common to
all primitive races. There is, indeed, a marked resemblance
between the habit of the Ainos in burying articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with the deceased for his use in the next world and
that of the North American Indians. But I am not
inclined to deduce any theory in reference to the origin
of the Ainos from the existence of these customs. Mankind,
in every part of the world, seems to have evolved his
religious beliefs in very much the same way. His conception
of the hereafter appears to have proceeded on
precisely similar lines. The higher his scale in civilisation
the more spiritual and the less material his conception
of the future. The lower his scale precisely the reverse
is the fact. The savage, which of course the Aino really
is, cannot imagine a future state where there is no eating
and drinking and hunting, and he, accordingly, thinks
it incumbent on him, in order to show his respect for the
dead, to provide the corpse with those articles which he
deems essential in that unknown world where, according
to his conception, eating and drinking and hunting will
be as prevalent as in this.</p>

<p>The Ainos have a great respect for the graves of their
dead, and Japanese legislation has taken the necessary
steps to prevent any tampering therewith. Some years
ago a few scientists from Europe went on an expedition
from Hakodate with a view of obtaining information
respecting the manners and customs of the Ainos. In
the course of this expedition some graves were broken
into and skulls and limbs extracted therefrom for the
purpose of being taken to Europe for scientific research.
This proceeding occasioned an angry outburst on the part
of this usually placid people, and the Japanese authorities
gave the necessary instructions to prevent the possibility
of such an occurrence in future. I suppose the scientists,
in the ardour of their enthusiasm, are hardly to be
blamed. Science too frequently overlooks sentiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
which is, after all, one of the most potent forces in the
world.</p>

<p>The dwellings of the Japanese are supposed to have
been evolved from those of the Ainos. Both build their
houses roof first, making the framework and placing
the supports with shorter pieces for rafters, all being tied
together with a rope made of some kind of fibre. Poles,
5 or 6 feet high at regular intervals are then placed in
the ground, each pole having a fork at the top and short
horizontal pieces from one to the other, the roof frame
is then erected on and secured to the poles and subsequently
thatched with straw. The floor is of earth,
with the fireplace in the centre. As in Japanese houses,
mats are used for sitting and sleeping purposes. The
utensils of the Ainos are much more primitive than those
in use by the Japanese people, and generally it may be
remarked of the Ainos that their wants are few and
that the people are content to live their own life in
their own way and only desire to be severely left alone.</p>

<p>The dress is very similar to that of the Japanese
peasant. The men, however, wear at certain seasons
thick rain-coats made of salmon skin, as also leggings
made of a fibre peculiar to themselves, and high boots
constructed of straw. I am sorry to have to relate that
the Ainos have a fondness for sak&eacute;, and there is a good
deal of intoxication among them. The climate of the
island of Yesso, as I have already remarked, is extremely
severe in the winter-time, and there can be little doubt
that many of the Ainos suffer extreme privations. There
have been a few cases of intermarriage between the two
races, but unions of this nature are not looked on with
any favour by either.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made by some of the missionaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in Japan to convert the Ainos to Christianity, but I fear
the attempts made in this direction have been attended
with a very scant measure of success. A people such
as this possesses minds of childlike simplicity, and to
endeavour to get it to comprehend the abstruse doctrines
and dogmas of Christianity is an almost hopeless task.
The climate of Yesso is such as to render it possible for
missionary efforts to take place only at certain seasons
of the year, and I do not think there has been, so far
as my information goes, any systematic propaganda of
Christianity among this interesting race.</p>

<p>It is certainly a somewhat extraordinary fact that
while the other islands of Japan have been rapidly
assimilating and are being steadily influenced by the
civilisation of Europe and America, the northern island
appears to be, except possibly at Hakodate, in a state
of complete isolation from all these influences and effects.
Whether the Ainos have any conception of the influences
at work in and the progress being made by the Empire
of which they are subjects, I do not know, but to me
it is both interesting and curious to regard this ancient
and decaying race, either indifferent to or ignorant of
all the bustle and hurry and worry of modern civilisation
so close to them and yet so far removed from their
childlike minds and ideas.</p>

<p>The question may be asked, How comes it that a highly
civilised people such as the Japanese have been for many
hundreds of years, have exercised practically no influence
upon this subject race inhabiting a portion of their
territory? A nation such as Japan, with a literature
and an art of its own, with two highly developed religious
systems, and with many of those other characteristics
which are included in the term civilisation? How is it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that neither art nor literature nor religion, nor any
other characteristic of civilisation has, in the slightest
degree, influenced this aboriginal race? Indeed, if the
theories of ethnologists in regard to the Ainos be correct,
and we are to judge by the ancient remains that have
been found throughout Japan, the Ainos, when they were
in undisputed possession of the Japanese Archipelago,
were in a much more advanced condition of civilisation
than they are to-day. The questions that I have put
afford food for reflection, but they are difficult, if not
impossible, to answer. I am certain, however, that the
Japanese Government desires to, if possible, preserve the
Aino race from extinction, and that it aspires to give this
ancient people all the advantages of education and
civilisation generally. Unfortunately the Ainos themselves
are the obstacle to the carrying into effect of this
project. They desire to live their own life in their own
way. They have not only no wish to be, but they resent
any effort to make them, either educated or civilised.
They are what some people would term children of
nature, out of place decidedly in a modern go-ahead
eclectic Power like Japan, but an interesting survival of
the past, and likewise an interesting reminder that the
highly civilised races of to-day have, in their time, been
evolved from very similar children of nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>JAPAN AS IT IS TO-DAY</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the Japan of to-day the world has before it a unique
example of an Eastern people displaying the power
to assimilate and to adopt the civilisation of the West,
while preserving its own national dignity unimpaired,&rdquo;
aptly remarks a modern writer. It is, indeed, in its
powers of assimilation and adaptation that Japan, I
think, stands unique among not only the nations of the
world at the present time, but amongst the nations of
whom we have any historical record. In one of his
books on Japan&mdash;books which I may, in passing, remark
give a more vivid insight into the life of the Japanese
people than the works of any other writer&mdash;Mr. Lafcadio
Hearn remarks that the so-called adoption of Western
civilisation within a term of comparatively few years
cannot mean the addition to the Japanese brain of any
organs or powers previously absent from her, nor any
sudden change in the mental or moral character of the
race. Changes of that kind cannot be made in a generation.
The Europeanising of Japan, Mr. Hearn in fact
suggests, means nothing more than the rearrangement
of a part of the pre-existing machinery of thought, while
the mental readjustments effected by taking on Western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
civilisation, or what passes for it, have given good results
only along directions in which the Japanese people have
always shown special capacity. There has, in a word,
he asserts, been no transformation&mdash;nothing more than
the turning of old abilities into new and larger channels.
Indeed the tendency of the people of Japan, when dispassionately
investigated, will be seen to have been always
moving in the same direction. A slight retrospect will,
I think, clearly prove the truth of this assertion.</p>

<p>It is now about fifty years since Japan was first
awakened, perhaps rudely awakened, from her slumber of
two and a half centuries. When the European Powers
and the United States of America knocked, perhaps somewhat
rudely, at her door, it turned slowly on its hinges
and creaked owing to the rust of many long years. How
came it that a country which had imported its art, literature,
religion, and civilisation, a country which until 1868
had a medi&aelig;val feudalism for its social basis, a country
which until then was notorious for the practice of hara-kiri
and the fierceness of its two-sworded Samurai should so
suddenly take on Western attributes and become a seat of
liberty and the exponent of Western civilisation in the
Far East? All this is to some persons a rather perplexing
problem. But the reasons are not, I think, far to seek. If
we go back many centuries we shall find that Japan, though
always tenacious of her national characteristics, never
evinced any indisposition to mingle with or adopt what
was good in other races. The national character for many
hundreds of years has always displayed what I may term
the germs of liberalism, and has not been influenced by
narrow and petty national ideals concerning the customs,
religion, art, or literature of other countries. As against
this statement may be urged the action of Japan in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
expelling the Portuguese missionaries, destroying thoroughly
Christianity, both buildings and converts, and effectually
and effectively shutting the country against all intercourse
with Europe and America for over two centuries. The
answer of the Japanese of to-day to this question is simple
enough. They point out that, although the object of
St. Francis Xavier and his missionaries was essentially
spiritual, viz., to convert Japan to Christianity, that of
many of the foreigners who accompanied or succeeded
him was not in any sense spiritual, but on the contrary
was grossly and wickedly material. Accordingly Japan,
having rightly or wrongly concluded that not only her
civilisation but her national life, her independent existence,
were menaced by the presence and the increasing number
of these foreigners, she decided, on the principle that
desperate diseases require desperate remedies, to expel
them and to effectually seal her country against any
possibility of future foreign invasions. I am not, I may
remark, defending her action in the matter; I am only
putting forward the views of Japanese men of light and
leading of to-day in regard thereto.</p>

<p>When, many centuries ago, the Koreans brought to
Japan the religion, laws, literature, and art of China, these
were adopted and assimilated. Both Buddhism and Confucianism
existed side by side in the country with the old
Shinto religion. And, accordingly, during the many
centuries which have elapsed since the religion of China
and the ethical doctrines of her great teacher were introduced
into Japan, there has never been a violent conflict
between them and the ancient religion of the country.
Had the Portuguese invaders confined themselves to a
religious propaganda only, the Christian converts they
made would not have been interfered with and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Christian religion, strong and vigorous, would have existed
uninterruptedly in Japan until to-day side by side with
Buddhism and Shintoism. When St. Francis Xavier
came to Japan Buddhism was the prevailing religion, and
it undoubtedly had, as it still has, a great hold upon the
people. But the preaching of the intrepid Jesuit and the
missionaries he brought with him had an enormous success.
The Christian religion was embraced by representatives of
every class. In the year 1550 St. Francis, writing to Goa,
placed on record for all time his opinion of the Japanese.
&ldquo;The nation,&rdquo; writes he, &ldquo;with which we have to deal here
surpasses in goodness any of the nations ever discovered.
They are of a kindly disposition, wonderfully desirous of
honour, which is placed above everything else. They
listen with great avidity to discourse about God and divine
things. In the native place of Paul they received us very
kindly, the Governor, the chief citizens, and indeed the
whole populace. Give thanks to God therefore that a very
wide and promising field is open to you for your well-roused
piety to spend its energies in.&rdquo; It certainly was a
remarkable fact that a nation which had for so many
centuries been under the influences of Buddhism should
have welcomed these Portuguese missionaries. But it
must be remembered that Japan had not that prejudice
against foreigners which is very often the outcome of
foreign conquest and foreign oppression. No foreign
Power had ever conquered or indeed set its foot in the
land. Both China and Korea had made various attempts
on the independence of Japan, but unsuccessfully. Japan
had never had to endure any humiliation at the hands of
foreign invaders, consequently her nationalism had no
narrow, selfish meaning, and accordingly she saw no reason
for putting any obstacle in the way of St. Francis Xavier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and his followers until she concluded, however much or
little reason there may have been for her conclusions, that
the incoming of these foreigners in some measure menaced
her national existence. Before she arrived at that conclusion
she was apparently prepared to welcome all that
was good in the ethical teaching of the Portuguese missionaries,
and, if a section of her population desired to embrace
a religion to whose ethical teaching she had no objection;
there was no reason, in her opinion, why that religion
should not exist side by side with those more ancient
religions which had lived amicably together during many
centuries.</p>

<p>For nearly two hundred and fifty years Japan resolved
to remain in a state of isolation. Then, as I have said,
European Powers and the great Republic of the West came
knocking and knocking loudly at her doors, and as a result
thereof her thinking men came to realise that in a state of
isolation a continued civilised existence is impossible.
Accordingly Japan, tentatively at first, opened certain portions
of her country to European intercourse, and as an
inevitable consequence thereof found it necessary to adopt
European ideas&mdash;and European armaments. The country
had kept out the aggressor for some two thousand years
or thereabouts, and Japan clearly saw that if the aggressor
was to be kept out in the future, the near future, she would
probably have to fight to maintain her national existence.
The war with China was the outcome of the feeling that
Korea under the suzerainty of China was a constant
menace to not only the prosperity but the existence of the
Empire. The same feeling undoubtedly led to the war
with Russia, as Japan considered, and rightly in my
opinion, that the possession of Korea by Russia meant the
loss of national independence. That war was not as so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
many wars have been, the result of a racial hatred, the
outcome of a spirit of revenge, or waged for aggressive
designs. It was forced upon Japan, and was in every sense
purely defensive. Japan waged it confident in her own
strength from the fact that in the two thousand years of
her history she had, in all the conflicts in which she had
engaged, kept in view the one ideal&mdash;the conservation of
the national existence, an ideal which she has consistently
realised.</p>

<p>The position of Japan at the present moment is not only
extremely interesting but extraordinary in a degree. She
is the cynosure for the eyes of the civilised world, and for
some years she has been subjected at the hands of experts
and amateurs of all descriptions to the most minute investigation.
Every phase of her national life has been rigidly
scrutinised and exhaustively written about. The national
character and characteristics have undergone the most
intricate psychological examination, and if the world does
not now know the real Japan it is certainly not from lack
of material, literary material, whereon to form a judgment.
Indeed the attention Japan has received has been sufficient
to turn the head of any people. I am not sure that
this large output of literature on matters Japanese has
effected very much in the direction of enabling a sound
judgment to be formed regarding the country and the
people. Many writers who have dissertated upon Japan
during the past couple of decades seem to have imagined
that they had discovered it, and their impressions have
been penned from that standpoint.</p>

<p>There used some years ago to be an advertisement of a
&ldquo;Popular Educator&rdquo; in which a youth with a curly head
of hair and a face of delightful innocence was depicted.
Underneath the portrait the inquiry was printed, &ldquo;What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
will he become?&rdquo; And there was then given an illustrated
alternative as to the appearance of this innocent youth at
different ages in his career according to the path he trod
in life. One alternative eventuated in the final evolution
of an ancient and, from his appearance, very palpable
villain, the other of a benevolent-looking old gentleman
who quite evidently only lived to do good. It seems to
me that a large number of persons in various parts of the
world are to-day, as they have been for some time past,
asking the question in reference to Japan, &ldquo;What will she
become?&rdquo; It is without doubt a highly interesting inquiry,
but the answer to it, so far as my knowledge goes, is not
like the advertisement I have referred to, one of two
courses&mdash;the one leading to perdition, the other to prosperity.
On the contrary, the answers seem to be as
numerous and varied as the answerers, and most of the
answers would appear to have been arrived at simply and
merely by the false premises and very often the entirely
erroneous &ldquo;facts&rdquo; of the inquirers.</p>

<p>A favourite and fallacious method of dealing with Japan
is that of regarding it as an Oriental nation, essentially
Oriental with a thin veneer of Occidentalism. People who
so reason, or occasionally do not reason at all but confine
themselves to mere assertions, suggest that the difference
between the Oriental and the Occidental is such that not
a few years of perfunctory contact but centuries of time
are necessary to bring about a real transmogrification.
Persons who so think point not only to the difference in
everything material in respect of East and West, but to a
radical difference in psychology, an entire distinction in
the mental outlook of each. They accordingly conclude
that the differences so evident on all sides are not mere
accidentals but fundamental, ineradicable. Scratch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Japanese, they in effect say, and beneath his veneer of
civilisation you will find the barbarian, barbarism and
Orientalism being with these persons synonymous terms.
And if any incredulity in the matter be expressed they
will triumphantly point to the recurrence of hara-kiri
among the soldiers and sailors in the late war. A well-known
writer on racial psychology has expressed himself
dogmatically on this very point. I will quote two or three
of his pronouncements in the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Each race possesses a constitution as unvarying as its
anatomical constitution. There seems to be no doubt that
the former corresponds to a certain special structure of
the brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A negro or a Japanese may easily take a university
degree or become a lawyer; the sort of varnish he thus
acquires is, however, quite superficial, and has no influence
on his mental constitution.... What no education can
give him because they are created by heredity alone, are
the forms of thought, the logic, and, above all, the character
of the Western man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross-breeding constitutes the only infallible means at
our disposal of transforming in a fundamental manner
the character of a people, heredity being the only force
powerful enough to contend with heredity. Cross-breeding
allows of the creation of a new race, possessing new
physical and psychological characteristics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, whether these views be correct in the main or
partially correct as regards other races, I have no hesitation
in describing them as inaccurate to a degree in
reference to the Japanese. Not peculiar brain formation,
but social evolution, environment, education are responsible
for the traits which distinguish the Japanese from other
Eastern nations. To assert, as do some psychological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
experts, that the mental constitution of races is as distinct
and unchangeable as their physiological or anatomical
characteristics is, to my mind, a fact not borne out by
the history of the world. Physiological or anatomical
distinctions are apparent, and can be classified; mental
idiosyncrasies do not lend themselves to cataloguing. It
is, I know, possible to draw up at any particular period a
list of what I may term the idiosyncrasies of any race at
that period. A writer in a London newspaper some little
time back attempted to do so in reference to Oriental
races generally. He enumerated the degraded position
of women, the licentiousness of the men, the recognition
and prevalence of prostitution, the non-desire of the
youth for play, contempt for Western civilisation, and
general hatred of foreigners. Admitting these charges
to be correct, the characteristics detailed are, I may
point out, merely ephemeral incidents. A contempt for
Western civilisation and hatred of the foreigner, for
example, which was certainly at one time pronounced
in Japan, are rapidly passing away. The position of
women in that country has also greatly improved, just
as it has improved in Europe, while as regards prostitution
and licentiousness Europe has, in my opinion, no
need to throw stones.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly a large number of persons who
are convinced, or have been convinced, by the arguments
of others, that the progress of Japan is a mere mushroom
growth which cannot last. A few years ago one of the
leading English papers in Japan attempted, to some
extent, to voice this opinion in an article striking the note
of warning for the benefit of the West against putting too
much faith in those writers who had intimately studied
Japan from within, and whose works were in general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
appreciation not only for their literary style, but for the
vivid insight they gave into everything respecting the
country. Quoth the journal in question:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the case of such writers as Sir Edwin Arnold and
Mr. Lafcadio Hearn, it is quite apparent that the logical
faculty is in abeyance. Imagination reigns supreme. As
poetic flights or outbursts the works of these authors on
Japan are delightful reading. But no one who has studied
the Japanese in a deeper manner, by more intimate daily
intercourse with all classes of the people than either of
these writers pretends to have had, can possibly regard a
large part of their description as anything more than
pleasing fancy. Both have given rein to the poetic
fancy, and thus have, from a purely literary point of
view, scored a success granted to few.... But as exponents
of Japanese life and thought they are unreliable....
They have given form and beauty to much that never
existed, except in vague outline or in undeveloped germs
in the Japanese mind. In doing this they have unavoidably
been guilty of misrepresentation.... The Japanese
nation of Arnold and Hearn is not the nation we have
known for a quarter of a century, but a purely ideal one
manufactured out of the author&rsquo;s brains. It is high time
that this was pointed out. For while such works please a
certain section of the English public, they do a great deal
of harm among a section of the Japanese public, as could
be easily shown in detail did space allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I quite admit the fact that many Japanese themselves
are quite convinced that there is a great gulf fixed between
the ideas and the philosophy of Europe and those of the
East, their own country included. In a book dealing particularly
with the art of Japan, written in English by a
Japanese, he attempts to emphasise this matter. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
remarks: &ldquo;Asia is one. The Himalayas divide only to
accentuate two mighty civilisations&mdash;the Chinese, with
its communism of Confucius, and the Indian, with its
individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy
barriers can interrupt for one moment that broad
expanse of love for the Ultimate and Universal which
is the common-thought inheritance of every Asiatic race,
enabling them to produce all the great religions of the
world, and distinguishing them from those maritime
people of the Mediterranean and the Baltic who loved
to dwell on the particular, and to search out the means
not the end of life.&rdquo; Indeed, the writer of this book appears
to be in a condition of transcendentalism in reference to the
East. In another portion of it he waxes eloquent in regard
to what he terms the glory of Asia, in language which I
will briefly quote. He remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the glory of Asia is something more positive
than these. It lies in that vibration of peace that beats
in every heart; that harmony which brings together
emperor and peasant; that sublime intuition of oneness
which commands all sympathy, all courtesy, to be its
fruits, making Takakura, Emperor of Japan, remove his
sleeping robes on a winter night because the frost lay
cold on the hearths of his poor; or Taiso of Tang forego
food because his people were feeling the pinch of famine;
... it lies in that worship of feeling which casts around
poverty the halo of greatness, impresses his stern simplicity
of apparel on the Indian prince, and sets up in
China a throne whose imperial occupant&mdash;alone amongst
the great secular rulers of the world&mdash;never wears a
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It were unkind to criticise eloquence of this description
too seriously. The fact, if it be a fact, that the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of China never wears a sword is in one sense interesting
but it proves nothing. It is well to get down from
eloquence of this kind to concrete facts, to come back
to the point whence we started, viz., What will Japan
become? What is her present condition? Any one who
compares the Japan of to-day with the Japan of, say,
thirty or forty years ago will, I think, impatiently sweep
aside some of the absurd theories to which I have
referred, psychological and otherwise. The unprejudiced
man, letting his mind indulge in retrospect, and comparing
that retrospective view with the present actuality, will, I
believe, have no difficulty in determining that though
Japan is and must remain an Oriental nation, what she
has acquired of recent years is neither veneer or varnish,
but has been assimilated into the very system of the
people. Very probably Japan will never become
thoroughly Occidentalised. There are many of us who
hope she never may. I believe, however, that in adopting
many Occidental customs and habits she will adapt
and modify them to her own needs, and in due course
evolve a race neither distinctly Occidental nor Oriental
while retaining many of her past customs and her ancient
characteristics. She will, in a word, be as far as possible
an eclectic nation, and it is, so far as I know, the first time
in the history of the world that an attempt has been made
to develop such.</p>

<p>There are, I know, many people in Europe as well as in
Japan who feel and express some apprehension in regard
to what they term young Japan. This term, like many
other terms, has never been accurately defined, but I take
it to mean that portion of the country consisting of the
young or younger men who have been educated according
to Western ideas, have acquired Western modes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thought, and have developed&mdash;I do not use the word in
an opprobrious sense&mdash;a bumptiousness. It is assumed,
on what grounds I know not, that this section&mdash;it must
after all be a small section&mdash;of the population of the
country has aspirations to make things &ldquo;hum,&rdquo; if I may
use an expressive bit of American slang. Young Japan,
we are led to believe, is intensely ambitious and extremely
cocksure. It cannot and will not go slow; on the contrary,
it is in a fearful hurry, and is in reference to every
matter political, commercial, religious, a hustler. It has
no doubts upon any subject, and no difficulty in regard to
making up its mind on any matter. This is what we hear
and read. How much of it all is true I know not. I am
very largely of opinion that this representation of young
Japan is altogether a caricature. Youth we know in
every clime is impulsive and impetuous. There is no
need to go to Japan to convince ourselves of that fact.
But youth, if it have these defects, also possesses enthusiasm,
and I should be inclined to describe that as one of
the most pleasing characteristics of the youth of Japan.
After all, time will cure Young Japan of some of its
defects. Young Japan will grow old, and if it loses its
enthusiasm it will gain experience. I not only have no
fear of these vivacious young men who love their country
and are proud of it. I regard them not as a danger, but
as a pleasing feature in the progress of Japan, and a potent
factor in its future prosperity.</p>

<p>The writers and critics to whom I have referred in this
chapter seem to be oblivious of the fact that progress is
the law of nature. It has nothing to do with either
climate or race. I admit that it may be affected by
environment or other causes of a temporary nature. The
Occidental visiting the East sees things that are strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to him&mdash;a people, the colour of whose skin and the
contour of whose features are different to his own; costume,
style of architecture, and many other matters
entirely dissimilar to what he has viewed in his own
country. He accordingly jumps to the absolutely
erroneous conclusion that these people are uncivilised,
and that their lack of civilisation is due to some mental
warp or some defect in either the structure or the size
of their brain. Of course such a conception is entirely
erroneous, and yet it is marvellous to what an extent it
prevails. These people are for all practical purposes the
same as himself, except that they have been affected by
various matters and circumstances that I have called
ephemeral. What a nation, like an individual, needs is
the formation of a distinct character. Now, the character
of a nation depends, in my opinion, on the high or low
estimate it has formed as to the meaning and purpose of
life, and also the extent to which it adheres to the
unwritten moral law, which is, after all, something
superior to, because higher than, mere legal enactments.
I confess that as I wander about this marvellous country
of Japan, as I mingle with its common people and see
them in various phases of their lives I say to myself, as
St. Francis Xavier said of them more than three hundred
years ago, &ldquo;This nation is the delight of my soul.&rdquo; The
critic, the hypercritic, is everywhere. He suspects everybody
and everything. He can find occult motives and
psychological reasons for everything. I confess I am a
trifle tired of the critic, especially the psychological critic,
in reference to Japan. I view the people there as they
are to-day, and I have satisfied myself that we can see at
work in Japan the formation of a nation with a character.
I care not to investigate the mental processes at work, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the difference between the brain of the Japanese and the
brain of the European. I do see this, however, that the
leaders of the people, the educated and cultured classes of
the land, are intent on cutting out of the national character
anything which is indefensible, or has been found unserviceable,
and equally intent on adopting and adapting
from any and every nation such qualities as it is considered
would the better enable Japan to advance on
the paths of progress and freedom, illuminating her way
as a nation and as a people by a shining illustration of all
that is best in the world, having sloughed off voluntarily
and readily every characteristic, however ancient, which
reason and justice and experience had shown to be
unworthy of a power aspiring to stand out prominently
before the world.</p>

<p>In Sir Rutherford Alcock&rsquo;s work on Japan, &ldquo;The Capital
of the Tycoon,&rdquo; published some forty-four years ago, a
work which, as I have elsewhere said, is of undoubted
value though somewhat marred by the prejudices of the
author, he attempted a forecast of the future of the
country, but, like so many prophets, his vaticinations
have proved highly inaccurate. &ldquo;Japan,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;is on the great highway of nations, the coveted of Russia,
the most absorbing, if not the most aggressive of all the
Powers; and a perpetual temptation alike to merchant
and to missionary, who, each in different directions, finding
the feudalism and spirit of isolation barriers to their
path, will not cease to batter them in breach, or undermine
them to their downfall. Such seems to be the probable
fate of Japan, and its consummation is little more
than a question of time. When all is accomplished,
whether the civilising process will make them as a people
wiser, better, or happier, is a problem of more doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
solution. One thing is quite certain, that the obstructive
principle which tends to the rejection of all Western innovations
and proselytism as abominations, is much too
active and vigorous in the Japanese mind to leave a hope
that there will not be violent and obstinate resistance;
and this inevitably leading to corresponding violence in
the assault, there must be a period of convulsion and disorder
before the change can be effected, and new foundations
laid for another social edifice.&rdquo; Whether the
civilising process will make the Japanese people wiser,
better, or happier is the problem the answer to which can
only be given in the future. Obviously we are not in a
position to completely answer this question to-day. Indeed,
before answering it at any time it might be advisable
to invite the definition of wisdom and happiness. There
were wisdom and happiness long prior to the time when
the merchant and the missionary to whom Sir Rutherford
Alcock refers battered and undermined Japan&rsquo;s feudalism
and spirit of isolation. But, <i>mirable dictu</i>, Japan, instead of
developing that obstructive principle which Sir Rutherford
considered was so active and vigorous in the Japanese
mind has, on the contrary, developed a spirit of adaptation
and assimilation of Western innovations, and in
so doing has in all probability saved herself from the
cupidity not only of Russia, but of other Western Powers.
Sir Rutherford Alcock was not a psychologist, but quite
evidently he too misread the Japanese mind and its
workings.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Japan as it is to-day gives the lie to nearly
all the prophets, and demonstrates that the psychologist
is merely a charlatan. Her development, her evolution
has proceeded along no particular lines. The fearful and
awful rocks in the way, medi&aelig;valism and feudalism, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
got rid of almost with a stroke of the pen, and everybody
in Japan, from the Emperor to the peasant, has adapted
himself to the changed order of things. It is the most
wonderful transformation scene in the history of the world,
and it is still in progress. What the end of it all will be
I have, bearing the dangers of prophecy well in mind,
attempted to show in a final chapter. But I may remark
that nothing in regard to the forces at work in Japan
of recent years, and the outcome of the same so far gives
me at any rate more unmixed pleasure than the way in
which the theorists have been confounded, those men
who cut and carve and label human beings, whether individually
or in the aggregate, as if they were mere blocks
of wood. The Oriental mind, we have been told, cannot
do this; Oriental prejudices and idiosyncrasies and modes
of thought and hereditary influences will not admit of
that; the traditions of the Far East, that mysterious
thing, will prevent the other&mdash;we have been told all this,
I repeat, and told it <i>ad nauseam</i>. Japan as it is to-day
refutes these prophecies, these dogmatic pronouncements,
psychical and ethnological. The Japanese race, when regarded
from what I deem to be the only correct standpoint
for forming a sound judgment as to the position
it holds among the races of the world, namely, in respect
of the size and convolution of the brain, occupies in my
opinion a high, a very high place. All other factors, often
given such undue prominence in forming an estimate as
to the character of any people I regard as mere accidentals.
The story of Japan during the last thirty or
forty years affords ample proof of what I have said; the
position of the country to-day offers visible demonstration
of it. Japan has reached and will keep the position of a
great Power, and the Japanese that of a great people, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
because of the preponderating mental abilities of the
population of the country, its capacity for assimilation,
its desire for knowledge, its pertinacity, strenuousness, and
aspirations to possess and acquire by the process of selection
the very best the world can give it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF JAPAN&mdash;PHYSICAL&mdash;MORAL&mdash;MENTAL</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> KNOW by experience, even if the history of the world
had not furnished many examples to prove it, that
prophecy is risky. It is a fascinating pastime inasmuch
as it affords the imaginative faculties full scope, but at
the same time it is a mistake to let the imagination run
riot. I have no intention, in considering the future of
Japan, of depicting an Arcadia or a Utopia the outcome
of one&rsquo;s desire rather than of the knowledge that one
possesses of the possibilities of the country and the belief
that in due course those possibilities will become actualities.
Of course I admit that I may be mistaken in my
estimate of the future, but I think an estimate of the
future can only be based on a knowledge of the present,
and it is upon that knowledge that I mean to attempt
some forecast of what I believe to be the destiny of Japan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Future of Japan&rdquo; is a theme that has exercised
the pens of many writers, who have given to the world
many and most divergent views in regard thereto&mdash;the
result, I think, of regarding the subject from a narrow or
single point of view, instead of looking at it broadly,
boldly, and dispassionately. In respect of a population
of between forty and fifty millions in rapid process of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
transformation and taking on perhaps rather hurriedly,
and, it may be, some superfluous or unnecessary attributes
of Western civilisation, it is not only possible but easy to
light on many ludicrous incidents and draw absolutely
false conclusions from them. One visitor to Japan, for
example, who wrote a series of essays on that country,
since produced in book form, the laudable object of which
was to present to the British public the real Japan with a
view of counteracting the effects of those &ldquo;superficial
narratives to be found by the dozen in circulating libraries
of the personal views and experiences of almost every
literary wayfarer who has crossed the Pacific,&rdquo; has followed
this bad plan in his remarks on &ldquo;The Future of
Japan.&rdquo; Imitation for imitation&rsquo;s sake is, or was, in his
opinion, a growing evil in Japan. A certain gentleman,
he relates, a wealthy merchant of Osaka, desired to celebrate
the two hundredth anniversary of a copper mine
coming into the possession of his family. The plan he
finally decided to adopt was to present each of his three
hundred employees with a swallow-tail coat. Another
Japanese gentleman, who had fallen in with the habit of
the New Year&rsquo;s Day call imitated from the Americans,
improved upon it by leaving on his doorstep a large box
with a lid and this notice above it: &ldquo;To Visitors. I am out,
but I wish you a Happy New Year all the same. N.B.&mdash;Please
drop your New Year&rsquo;s Presents into the box.&rdquo;
Over a well-known tobacconist&rsquo;s shop the writer of the
book in question observed the following notice: &ldquo;When
we first opened our tobacco store at Tokio our establishment
was patronised by Miss Nakakoshi, a celebrated
beauty of Inamato-ro, Shin-yoshiwara, and she would
only smoke tobacco purchased at our store. Through
her patronage our tobacco became widely known, so we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
call it by the name of Ima Nakakoshi. And we beg to
assure the public that it is as fragrant and sweet as the
young lady herself. Try it and you will find our words
prove true.&rdquo; Finally, over a pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop in Tokio
he read and made a note of the following: &ldquo;Cakes and
Infections.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now what do these several trivial, indeed contemptible,
anecdotes prove? What arguments in regard to a nation
of forty-seven millions of people can be bolstered up by
instancing the imperfect acquaintance of a Japanese pastry-cook
with the English language? The writer does not in
so many words delineate the future of Japan as it appears
to him, but he suggests it, and his Japan of the future is
quite evidently to be nothing more or less than a kind of
international dustheap whereon Europe and America have
dumped all that is bad and rotten and deplorable in their
modern social and political life. Here is the inferential
forecast of the gentleman in question: &ldquo;When Japan
rings with the rattle of machinery; when the railway
has become a feature of her scenery; when the boiler-chimney
has defaced her choicest spots, as the paper-makers
have already obliterated the delights of Oji; when
the traditions of yashiki and shizoku alike are all finally
engulfed in the barrack-room; when her art reckons its
output by the thousand dozen; when the power in the land
is shared between the politician and the plutocrat; when
the peasant has been exchanged for the &lsquo;factory hand,&rsquo;
the kimono for the slop-suit, the tea-house for the music-hall,
the geisha for the lion comique, and the daimio for
the beer-peer&mdash;will Japan then have made a wise bargain,
and will she, looking backward, date a happier era from
the day we forced our acquaintance upon her at the
cannon&rsquo;s mouth?&rdquo;</p>

Criticism of this kind, if it may be dignified by that
term, no doubt affords opportunity for what is considered
smart writing, and enables the persons indulging in it to
air their witticisms and show their sense of the humorous,
but it not only serves no useful purpose, but, on the contrary,
is pernicious in its effects, inasmuch as it occasions,
not unnaturally, a feeling of soreness on the part of those,
whether individuals or a nation, who are made the subject
of it. Japan has too often been the butt of the humourist.
I have no desire to deprecate humour, which no doubt
gives a savour to life, but that humour which is only
exercised at the expense of others, in my opinion, needs
reprobation. As I have said, Japan among nations has
been subjected to too much of it, and it is to be hoped
that in future writers about the country will endeavour to
avoid making their little jokes, or serving up afresh the
antiquated chestnuts of the foreign community.</p>

<p>The future of Japan may, I think, be considered
under some half-dozen headings: The physical improvement
of the Japanese race; Its moral advancement;
Its intellectual advancement; Japan&rsquo;s national future;
Her political future; and finally, The influence of the
Japanese Empire on other Far Eastern races and on the
world generally.</p>

<p>As regards the physical improvement of the race, I
admit this is a somewhat difficult subject in regard to
which to make any forecast. The stature of the Japanese
is undoubtedly small, and the chest measurement small
likewise. At the same time, any one moving about Japan
must have noticed the fact that there are quite a large
number of very tall men and women in the country, and
that a goodly proportion of the inhabitants compare
favourably in their physical attributes with European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
people. As I have observed elsewhere in this book, the
dietary of the Japanese race has for many centuries back
been almost entirely a vegetarian one. I know very well
that vegetarianism has its advocates, and some of the
arguments put forward in support of it are plausible if not
convincing. At the same time, I think, it cannot be denied
that those races which have been in the habit of eating
meat for many centuries have, as regards physique, demonstrated
that whether man was or was not intended to be a
carnivorous animal, his development into a carnivorous
animal has at any rate succeeded in enhancing and developing
his physical powers. Of late years there has been
possibly as the result of intercourse with Europeans, a
large increase in the number of the inhabitants of Japan
who eat meat. This tendency on the part of the population
is growing, and I believe in the course of comparatively
few years there will be a radical change in the dietary
of the people. This change, if it be effected, must, I would
suggest, have a material influence on their physique. We
all know that food is essential for the building up of the
human frame and its maintenance, and I think there are few
people who would question the fact that the condition of
the human frame, whether in individuals or the aggregates
of individuals that we term nations, must be largely
affected by the food partaken of. I, accordingly, look
forward, not immediately of course, to a material change
in the general physique of the Japanese people. I am
not, as I know some persons are, of opinion that that
change is likely to be brought about by intermarriage or
unions of a temporary nature between Japanese and
Europeans. There have been a few marriages, and
there have no doubt been a good many unions, but the
effect on the national breed has been small, and though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
it may be to some extent greater in the future, I do
not look in this direction for any alteration in the
physical characteristics of the Japanese people. That
alteration will, in my opinion, be brought about by a
change in the food of the people.</p>

<p>As regards the moral advancement of the Japanese
race I shall say little, for the somewhat paradoxical
reason that it is a matter on which so much might be
said. Indeed, this is a subject on which a definition of
the term moral might be advisable before entering into
any prolonged consideration of it. I shall not attempt
that definition, simply because I feel convinced that to
do so would be to provoke controversy. As I have
said in this book, moral, morality, and immorality are
all terms that have to some extent lost their original
meaning. I may say briefly in this connection that I
use the term moral advancement simply and solely in
respect of the practice of the duties of life from a high
ethical point of view. That is, I know, a somewhat
vague definition, but I think it will serve its purpose.
Ever since Japan has been thrown open to foreigners we
have heard a good deal about morality and immorality,
both in the strict and the perverted sense of those
words. The European who came there, male and female,
was, or affected to be, shocked at the relations between
the sexes he found prevailing. He saw prostitution
recognised and regulated. He heard of, and in the old
days possibly saw, something of phallic worship. He
witnessed or heard of men and women making their
ablutions together in public wash-houses, and he&mdash;sometimes
it was a she&mdash;affected to be horrified at such a proceeding.
Better, much better, it was inferred, the custom
of the lower classes in England, never to wash at all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
than this horrible outrage on public decency. And then
the merchant or the trader who came to Japan, he
also prated about commercial immorality, and the prevalence
of untruthfulness among the Japanese with
whom he did business. And in other directions too
there were criticisms passed upon Japanese manners and
customs, and many of these were condemned and
denounced as immoral or wicked very often for no
better reason than that they differed from those that
obtained in Europe. However much or little ground
there may have been for these charges against the
Japanese people, I am not now concerned to discuss.
One thing I will remark&mdash;that the Japanese possess
two religions which, whatever their effects and no matter
to what extent superstition may have been engrafted
on them, have always held up a high moral standard.
And if one dips even cursorily into the writings of the
ethical teachers of Japan in the past, we invariably find
the inculcation of an exalted standard of morals. Indeed,
the practice of the Japanese people at the present
time, as in all times in regard to the relations between
parents and children, of wife to husband, of the people
to the State, have been beyond criticism. In these
matters Western nations have much to learn from
them. Since the opening of the country to Europe,
the Japanese Government has shown itself alive to
European criticism on many points. It has effectually
stamped out phallic worship; it has, in deference to
European susceptibilities, abolished mixed bathing in
the public wash-houses; and in various other ways it
has striven in the direction of raising the standard of
moral conduct throughout the country. That it has not
attempted to put down prostitution, but, on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
has recognised and regulated it, has been made a charge
against it. The Japanese Government has most likely
come to the conclusion that prostitution cannot be put
down, and such being the case it has decided that, with
a view of obviating those evils which are the outcome
of it, the only alternative is to regulate it. I
admit that in an ideal state of existence prostitution
would not exist, but no country in the world has yet
reached or approximated that ideal state. The evil of
prostitution is just as flagrant in Europe as in the
East, but Japan so far alone among the Great Powers
of the world has seen fit to tackle this difficult and
delicate matter, and to some extent regulate it. That
her rulers look forward to the time when the Yoshiwara
shall have ceased to exist I firmly believe, and
I am convinced that they mean to do everything
possible towards that consummation. But the rulers
of Japan are not mere sentimentalists; they have to
recognise facts, and recognising facts they have done
what seems best to them under the circumstances.</p>

<p>As regards commercial morality, I believe even the
European merchants and traders in the country admit
that there has of late years been a marked improvement.
In old Japan commercialism was looked down upon.
Making a profit out of buying and selling was regarded
as degrading; those who indulged in such practices were
despised, and not unnaturally the trader, finding himself a
member of a contemned class, lived down to the low level
on which he had been placed. In old Japan traders, in
the presence of the Samurai, were, when addressing him,
required to touch the ground with their foreheads; when
talking to him they had to keep their hands on the ground.
Such a state of things, of course, has long been effete, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the influences thereof remained for a considerable time
after the acts had ceased. There has now been effected
a revulsion of feeling in such matters. Commerce is
honoured, trade is esteemed, and the Japan of to-day is
convinced of the fact that on her commerce, trade, and
industries the future of the country largely depends. Men
of the highest rank, men of the greatest culture, men of the
deepest probity are now embarked in trade and commerce
in Japan; the whole moral atmosphere connected with
trade has changed, and there are at the present time no
more honourable men in the whole commercial world than
those of Japan. In this matter there has undoubtedly been
an enormous advance in ideas and ideals. This advance,
I believe, is destined to extend in other directions&mdash;indeed,
in every direction. The Japan of to-day has, I think, so
far as I have been able to gauge it, a feeling&mdash;a deep feeling,
which perhaps I can best describe as <i>noblesse oblige</i>.
It is sensible of the position the country has attained; it
is full of hope and enthusiasm for the future thereof; it
believes implicitly that it is incumbent on it not only to
attain but to maintain a high moral standard in every
direction. It has been urged as against the Japan of
to-day by a writer on the subject that Spencer and Mill
and Huxley have been widely read by the educated classes,
and that Western thought and practice as to the structure
of society and the freedom of the individual have been
emphasised throughout the country. I confess to feeling
no alarm in regard to the moral future of Japan because it
has perused the works of the three philosophers named.
It gives me no trepidation to read that Mill&rsquo;s work on
&ldquo;Representative Government&rdquo; has been translated into a
volume of five hundred pages in Japanese and reached its
third edition. I am, on the contrary, pleased to learn that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Japan of to-day is concerned about culture, desirous of
reading the works of those great philosophers whose names
are among the immortal. There are no principles enunciated
in any of the books of Spencer, Mill, or Huxley that,
so far as I know, can undermine the moral character of the
Japanese. On the contrary, I believe that a perusal of
the writings of those great men will tend to assist the
Japanese into a clearer understanding of moral principles,
and in a desire to apply them to the duties of life. I look
forward with great hope and a pronounced confidence to
the moral future of Japan. Everything that I have seen
in the country, everything that I have been able to learn
respecting the people thereof&mdash;the ideas prevailing, the
teaching given in its schools and universities, the whole
trend of thought in the land, the literature read and produced,
the aspirations, in fact, of the Japanese people
to-day&mdash;lead me to think and to believe most firmly that
in the Japan of the future we shall witness a nation on a
higher moral plane than any of those with which the
history of the world acquaints us.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the moral advancement of Japan
is its intellectual advancement. I have referred to the
statement made by a writer that the Japan of to-day is
addicted to reading the works of certain English philosophers,
and that one of these books translated into
Japanese had run through several editions. This fact is
typical of the intellectual ferment, the thirst for knowledge
of all kinds that exists in the country to-day. That craving
is not for philosophical works alone; it extends to and
embraces every form of literature of an instructive or
enlightening character. It is in evidence in the higher
schools and the universities of the country; it is to be
witnessed in the many periodicals which exist for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
promotion of culture and the spread of knowledge. This
intellectual ferment, as I have, I think, appropriately
termed it, is extending rapidly, and is, I believe, destined
to assume much greater proportions. The literature of the
world is at the present time literally being devoured by
Young Japan. I do not regard this literary voracity as the
mere outcome of curiosity, or as in any way symptomatic
of mere mental unrest. Young Japan appears, like Lord
Bacon, to take all knowledge for its field of study, and in
accord with the philosophical principles of that great man,
the principles of utility and progress, to be concerned with
everything that can alleviate the sufferings and promote
the comforts of mankind. Of course, at the present time
this condition of craving for knowledge is confined, from
the point of view of numbers, to a small portion of the
people. But the intellectuals of every country are in a
minority&mdash;in some countries in a miserable minority&mdash;and
the influence they exercise is never proportionate to their
numbers. At the same time the intellectuals of Japan are,
in view of the fact that the country has for some short
time been open to Western influences, an amazingly large
proportion of the population. I am of opinion that this
intellectual movement in Japan is destined to widen considerably,
and that its influence on the people will be
immense. During the whole history of the world the
potency of mind over matter has been the greatest wonder.
In these present days this potency is even more pronounced,
and mere brute force is nowadays only made
effective when it is influenced and regulated and organised
by mind. I regard the intellectual development of Japan
as one of the most pleasing features that have accrued from
its contact with Western civilisation. I do not mean to
suggest that there was an intellectual atrophy in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
country prior to those influences making themselves felt,
but there was an isolation which is never good for intellectual
development. The broader the sympathies of
nations, as of individuals, the wider their outlook, the
better for their mental progress. When Japan was in a
condition of isolation the literature available for her people
was limited both in style and quantity. Her people now
have at their disposal the intellect of the whole civilised
world, the great thoughts of the great men of all ages.
And it is pleasing to be able to relate that no more appreciative
readers of the world&rsquo;s classics are to be found than
the young intellectuals of Japan to-day. I have said that
I regard this intellectual enthusiasm as one of the most
pleasing features of modern Japan. That it is destined to
have great results I am firmly convinced. I believe, and I
am not naturally an optimist, that in the Japan of the
future, the not far-distant future, the world is destined to
see a nation not only morally but mentally great, a nation
which will develop in conjunction those high moral qualities
which will give it what I may term a pronounced, a well-defined
character, and an intellectual greatness superior to
that of ancient Greece and Rome, because restrained and
illumined by the predominance and potency of moral
characteristics which those great nations did not possess.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE FUTURE OF JAPAN&mdash;NATIONAL&mdash;POLITICAL&mdash;ITS
INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD</h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> HAVE now come to my final chapter, in which I
propose to offer some remarks embodying my opinion
as to the future of Japan from a national and political
standpoint, as also her influence upon the world generally.
The theme is a great one, and would require a volume for
its proper treatment. Obviously, therefore, it cannot be
dealt with other than cursorily in the few pages I am
about to devote to it.</p>

<p>Readers of this book will, I think, have had borne in
upon them the fact that I am not only an ardent admirer
of, but a believer in Japan and the Japanese. I utterly
scout the idea put forward by some writers that what they
have taken on of Western civilisation is either a veneer or
a varnish, or that the advancement of the nation resembles
the growth of the mushroom and is no more stable. I
regard the Japanese as a serious people and the nation as
having a serious purpose. If I did not there would be no
need for me to dilate upon its future, for the simple reason
that its future would be incomprehensible, and accordingly
be absolutely impossible to forecast. As it is, it appears to
me that the future of Japan is as plain as the proverbial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
pike-staff. I say this with a full knowledge of the dangers
attendant on prophecy and the risk to the reputation of
the vaticinator should events prove that he was mistaken
in his prevision or erroneous in his conclusions.</p>

<p>I have traced in these pages what I may term the
national development of Japan; how, after two and a half
centuries of isolation, it, recognising the force of circumstances,
determined to impose upon its own ancient
civilisation all that was best in that of the West, and,
having so determined, took practical and effective steps
to that end. What is to be the result of it all, the result,
that is to say, not upon a few thousands, or hundreds of
thousands, of Japanese, but upon the nation as a whole?
Will these accretions on the old civilisation of the land
mould and influence and alter the people generally, or will
the effect be circumscribed and merely develop a class
standing out apart from the great body of the people and
affecting a superiority because of its Western culture?
In my opinion the result will be not partial, but universal,
though not immediate. There are, of course, large portions
of Japan, many millions of its population, upon whom the
opening up of the country has, as yet had little, if any,
effect. Many of the Japanese people have hardly ever
seen a foreigner, or, if they have, have viewed him with no
little curiosity. They certainly have not realised, and
possibly have not suspected, the effect which foreign
influences are likely to have upon this Land of the Rising
Sun. But influences, we know, may be effective without
being felt, and I am convinced, from what I have seen and
heard and the investigations I have been enabled to make,
that the Japan of to-day is not only in transition&mdash;in rapid
transition&mdash;but that its evolution is sure and certain, and
that the result thereof will be the ultimate development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
a nation which will assuredly impress the world and will
very probably have a much more potent effect upon it than
mere numbers would account for. It is the building up of
a nation such as this that I confidently look forward to in
the future. We of this generation may not, probably will
not, live to see it&mdash;we certainly shall not in its ultimate
development&mdash;but we can already see at work the forces
which are to produce it, and the eye of faith, of a reasonable
faith, built not on mere surmise or ardent hopes, but
upon the expectation of a reasonable issue to the factors
at work producing it, assures us that the Japan of the
future will, as I have said, be a nation whose light will
shine, and shine brilliantly, before the whole world.</p>

<p>And as regards the political future of this wonderful
country, I feel I can speak with equal confidence. What a
marvellous change has come over this land, or our conception
of this land, since the first British Minister resident
there penned his impressions on approaching it. &ldquo;A
cluster of isles,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;appeared on the farthest
verge of the horizon, apparently inhabited by a race at
once grotesque and savage&mdash;not much given to hospitality,
and rather addicted to martyrising strangers of whose creed
they disapproved. Thus much stood out tolerably distinctly,
but little else that was tangible. Severance from
all social ties, isolation from one&rsquo;s kind, and a pariah
existence, far away from all centres of civilisation&mdash;far
beyond the utmost reach of railroad or telegraph&mdash;came
much more vividly before me; and in Rembrandt masses
of shade, with but one small ray of light, just enough to
give force and depth to the whole&mdash;a sense of duty, a duty
that <em>must</em> be done, whether pleasant or otherwise, and about
which there was no choice. What a world of anxiety and
doubt the consciousness of this saves us!&rdquo; This exordium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
reads more like the utterance of a man being led out to
execution than a Minister going to a country possessing an
ancient civilisation&mdash;a civilisation which had had its effect
on every phase of the national life. What would not many
of us now give to have been in the place of Sir Rutherford
Alcock, visiting this land shortly after it had been opened
after 250 years of isolation! How we should revel in its
artistic treasures, which had not then been dispersed all
over the world; and what pleasure we should have taken
in seeing feudalism otherwise than in the pages of history!
And yet Sir Rutherford Alcock was only expressing the
opinions of his time. He could see nothing in Japan but
a grotesque and uncivilised people whom the Western
nations had to deal with in a peremptory manner. What
a change there has been in the intervening forty-four
years! Japan now stands out prominently among the
nations, her political future appears to be secure, and it is
none the less secure because of the difficulties she has
encountered and overcome in attaining her present position.
I emphasise all the more readily her present and future
political position since, as I have previously observed in
this book, I believe that that position will be one exercised
for the good of the world. I look upon Japan as a great
civilising factor in the future of the human race because,
strong though she is and stronger though she will become,
I am positive that her strength will never be put forward
for any selfish aims or from any improper motives. It is
for this reason that I welcome the alliance with Great
Britain. I hope that alliance will not be limited to any
term of years, but will be extended indefinitely, because in
it I see a prospect and an assurance for the peace of the
world.</p>

<p>Inseparable from any allusion to the political future of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Japan is some consideration of the influence that she is
likely to exercise upon the world generally. Any person
taking up an atlas and looking at the position occupied
by Japan must, if he is of a thoughtful disposition, be
impressed by it. Take the question of the Pacific&mdash;one
which, in view of the change in the policy of the United
States of recent years, must assume considerable importance
in the future. There are various factors which must
be taken into account here. The construction of the
Panama Canal is one, the completion of the Siberian
Railway another, the development of Canada and the
completion of the railway lines that now penetrate nearly
every part of that vast dominion is a third. Japan is now,
in fact, the very centre of three great markets&mdash;those of
Europe, Asia, and America. In the struggle for the
mastery of the Pacific, which appears certain to come,
and will probably come sooner than many people suppose,
Japan is certain to take a momentous part. Not only in
respect of her own islands, but in reference to the great
island of Formosa, ceded to her by China as the outcome
of the war with that Power, Japan occupies a unique and a
most important position in the Pacific. As regards the
mastery of the Pacific, in reference to which so much has
been written and so much speculation, a large amount of
it unprofitable, has been indulged, I shall say but little.
On the shores of the Pacific Russia still remains a power,
which, though defeated by Japan, is still one of considerable
importance. On the other side of the ocean there is
the United States, which, as some persons think, has given
hostages to fortune by annexing the Philippine Islands.
England, moreover, claims consideration in respect not
only of her possessions in the Straits Settlements, Hong
Kong, &amp;c., but by reason of her great Navy and, I may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
add, her alliance with Japan. Then, too, there are China,
and, if of less importance, France and Germany. Of all
these Japan, in my opinion, occupies the commanding
position. She not only occupies the commanding position,
but she is, I think, from various causes, bound to play a
great part in the future mastery of the Pacific.</p>

<p>It is apparent that in the attainment and assertion of that
mastery naval power must have a great and predominant
part, and it is to the development of her naval power
that Japan is devoting all her energies. Like Great
Britain, from whom she has learned many lessons in
this respect, she sees that an island empire can only
maintain its position by possessing an overpowering
naval force. As I have said before, I am fully convinced
of the fact that in the development of her
Navy, as of her Army, Japan has no aggressive designs.
Her aspiration is the security and prevention from
invasion of her island and the preservation of her
national independence. At the same time, situated as
she is in the great Pacific Ocean, she has palpably,
from her position, rights and responsibilities and
duties outside the immediate confines of her Empire.
That, I think, will be admitted by any one. The
phrase, &ldquo;spheres of influence&rdquo; has become somewhat
hackneyed of recent years, and it has occasionally been
used to give colour to aggressive designs. There may,
too, be people who would say that spheres of influence
is not a term that can properly be applied to a great
water-way such as the Pacific. I am not, however, on
the present occasion arguing with pedants. What I
desire is to broadly emphasise the fact that in the
future of the Pacific&mdash;those innumerable isles dotted
here and there over its surface, Japan is a factor that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
cannot be left out of account. Year by year her
position there is increasing in importance. Steamers ply
to her ports weekly from Vancouver and San Francisco.
The Japanese population are emigrating to the Pacific
shores of America, the trade and commerce of Japan
with the American Continent are growing and broadening.
Everything in fact tends to show that within a
comparatively short space of time Japan will have
asserted her position, not only as a Great World
Power, but as a great commercial nation in the
Pacific. What is to be the outcome of it all? is the
question that will naturally arise to the mind. I think
that one outcome of it will be, as I have shown, the
capture by Japan of the Chinese trade, if not in its
entirety, at any rate in a very large degree. Another
outcome will, I believe, be the enormous development of
Japanese trade with both the United States and Canada.
Some people may remark that these are not essentially
political matters, and that I am somewhat
wandering from my point in treating of them in connection
with the influence of Japan upon the world
generally. I do not think so. A nation may assert
its influence and emphasise its importance to just as
great an extent by its trade as by the double-dealings
of diplomacy or by other equally questionable methods.
Of one thing I am convinced, and that is that the
influence of Japan upon the rest of the world will
be a singularly healthy one. That country has fortunately
struck out for itself, in diplomacy as in other
matters, a new line. It has not behind it any traditions,
nor before it prejudices wherewith to impede its
progress. The diplomacy of Japan will, accordingly, be
conducted in a straightforward manner, and its record
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
so far in this respect has, I think, provided a splendid
object-lesson for the rest of the world. The influence
of Japan upon the other nations will I hope, as I
believe, continue to be of a healthy nature. If that
country sets forth prominently the fact that while
aspiring to be great, it possesses none of those attributes
that we have previously associated with great
nations, the attributes of greed, covetousness, aggressiveness,
and overbearing&mdash;an arrogant attitude in regard to
weaker Powers, it will have performed a notable service
in the history of the world. For myself I have no
doubt whatever that Japan will teach this lesson, and
in teaching it will have justified the great place that
she has attained among the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>I have now concluded the task that I set before myself.
My readers must be judges as to the measure of success,
if any, I have attained in it. To attempt a survey of
the past, present, and future of a great and ancient nation
within the limited space at my disposal has been by
no means easy. Every subject I have had under
consideration has invited discursiveness, and tempted
me to linger and dilate upon it, and it alone. The
fascination of Japan must be upon every one, or almost
every one, who writes about it, and that fascination is,
I may observe, like the art of the country, catholic.
Whether we deeply and exhaustively investigate one
subject and one subject only, or take a hurried glance
at every or almost every subject, we feel a glamour in
respect of this wonderful country and its equally wonderful
people. While I have endeavoured to prevent this
fascination, this glamour, affecting my judgment, I am
not ashamed to plead guilty to, but am, in fact, rather
proud of it. Indeed, I shall feel gratified if a perusal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of this book induces a few persons here and there to study
still more deeply the history, the religion, the art of
Japan, and the whole trend of events in that country
during the past forty years. Every phase of the national
life lends itself to investigation, and will, I feel sure,
reward the investigator. He will, unless he be a person of
a singularly unemotional disposition, utterly lacking in all
those finer feelings which especially distinguish man from
the brutes, hardly fail of being, before he has proceeded
far in his investigations, quickly under the alluring
influences of this Far Eastern land, entering heartily,
zealously, and enthusiastically into its national life and the
developments thereof in all their various ramifications.</p>

<p>The fascination that Japan has exercised upon writers
such as Arnold and Hearn is what it does, though no
doubt in a smaller degree, upon less gifted men. It is
given to few to drink in and absorb the subtle charm
of the country so thoroughly and express it so graphically
and delicately, with such beauty and power and withal so
much truth as have those brilliant men. I regard this
great and growing fascination of Occidentals for this
fair Eastern land and its inhabitants as a long step in the
direction of the realisation of the brotherhood of man; that
ideal state of things which we hope for so expectantly,
longingly, perhaps too often sceptically; that happy
time when national prejudices, jealousies, and animosities
will have faded into oblivion, when nations by the simple
process of studying one another, as Japan has been studied
of recent years, will get to understand one another, when
the literature and art of nations will be no longer merely
national, but world possessions, when wars shall have
ceased and the policy of aggression have come to be
regarded as an evil thing, when, in a word, the brotherhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of man shall be no longer an idle dream, a mere speculative
aspiration which no practical person ever expected to
see realised, but an actuality within measurable distance
of being accomplished. All these things may as yet be
dreams, but let us dream them. The more they are
dreamed, the more likely is the prospect of their realisation.
One thing at least fills me with ardent hope, and that
is the Japan, as I see it to-day, compared with the Japan
of forty years ago. If such an upheaval is possible for
one nation, who shall put any bounds to the potentialities
of the world? So let us dream our dreams, and in our
waking moments cast afar our eyes upon the land of the
Rising, aye, now the Risen Sun, take heart and dream
again in quiet confidence that some day, in some future
reincarnation, mayhap, we shall witness the realisation of
our hopes, and see that after all our dreams were merely
an intelligent anticipation of the glad time coming.</p>
